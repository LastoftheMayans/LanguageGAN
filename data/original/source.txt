All Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Hamilton, and Shakespeare texts are adapted from gutenberg.org. The table of contents, dedication, author's notes, publication information, character lists, annotations, citations, and license have been removed to not interfere with the model. The title, author, chapter, section, and book names have been retained. Minor adjustments were made to the title and author formatting for consistency. All licenses have been reproduced in the license directory.
