Enter three Witches . *stop*
1 . *stop*
When shall we three meet againe ? *stop*
In Thunder , Lightning , or in Raine ? *stop*
2 . *stop*
When the Hurley-burley 's done , When the Battaile 's lost , and wonne 3 . *stop*
That will be ere the set of Sunne 1 . *stop*
Where the place ? *stop*
2 . *stop*
Vpon the Heath 3 . *stop*
There to meet with Macbeth 1 . *stop*
I come , Gray-Malkin All . *stop*
Padock calls anon : faire is foule , and foule is faire , Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Secunda . *stop*
Alarum within . *stop*
Enter King , Malcome , Donalbaine , Lenox , with attendants , meeting a bleeding Captaine . *stop*
King . *stop*
What bloody man is that ? *stop*
he can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the Reuolt The newest state Mal . *stop*
This is the Serieant , Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought 'Gainst my Captiuitie : Haile braue friend ; Say to the King , the knowledge of the Broyle , As thou didst leaue it Cap . *stop*
Doubtfull it stood , As two spent Swimmers , that doe cling together , And choake their Art : The mercilesse Macdonwald ( Worthie to be a Rebell , for to that The multiplying Villanies of Nature Doe swarme vpon him ) from the Westerne Isles Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply 'd , And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling , Shew 'd like a Rebells Whore : but all 's too weake : For braue Macbeth ( well hee deserues that Name ) Disdayning Fortune , with his brandisht Steele , Which smoak 'd with bloody execution ( Like Valours Minion ) caru 'd out his passage , Till hee fac 'd the Slaue : Which neu ' r shooke hands , nor bad farwell to him , Till he vnseam 'd him from the Naue toth ' Chops , And fix 'd his Head vpon our Battlements King . *stop*
O valiant Cousin , worthy Gentleman Cap . *stop*
As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection , Shipwracking Stormes , and direfull Thunders : So from that Spring , whence comfort seem 'd to come , Discomfort swells : Marke King of Scotland , marke , No sooner Iustice had , with Valour arm 'd , Compell 'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles , But the Norweyan Lord , surueying vantage , With furbusht Armes , and new supplyes of men , Began a fresh assault King . *stop*
Dismay 'd not this our Captaines , Macbeth and Banquoh ? *stop*
Cap . *stop*
Yes , as Sparrowes , Eagles ; Or the Hare , the Lyon : If I say sooth , I must report they were As Cannons ouer-charg 'd with double Cracks , So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe : Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds , Or memorize another Golgotha , I can not tell : but I am faint , My Gashes cry for helpe King . *stop*
So well thy words become thee , as thy wounds , They smack of Honor both : Goe get him Surgeons . *stop*
Enter Rosse and Angus . *stop*
Who comes here ? *stop*
Mal . *stop*
The worthy Thane of Rosse Lenox . *stop*
What a haste lookes through his eyes ? *stop*
So should he looke , that seemes to speake things strange Rosse . *stop*
God saue the King King . *stop*
Whence cam'st thou , worthy Thane ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
From Fiffe , great King , Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie , And fanne our people cold . *stop*
Norway himselfe , with terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor , The Thane of Cawdor , began a dismall Conflict , Till that Bellona 's Bridegroome , lapt in proofe , Confronted him with selfe-comparisons , Point against Point , rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme , Curbing his lauish spirit : and to conclude , The Victorie fell on vs King . *stop*
Great happinesse Rosse . *stop*
That now Sweno , the Norwayes King , Craues composition : Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men , Till he disbursed , at Saint Colmes ynch , Ten thousand Dollars , to our generall vse King . *stop*
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue Our Bosome interest : Goe pronounce his present death , And with his former Title greet Macbeth Rosse . *stop*
Ile see it done King . *stop*
What he hath lost , Noble Macbeth hath wonne . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

1 . *stop*
Where hast thou beene , Sister ? *stop*
2 . *stop*
Killing Swine 3 . *stop*
Sister , where thou ? *stop*
1 . *stop*
A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe , And mouncht , & mouncht , and mouncht : Giue me , quoth I. Aroynt thee , Witch , the rumpe-fed Ronyon cryes . *stop*
Her Husband 's to Aleppo gone , Master o'th ' Tiger : But in a Syue Ile thither sayle , And like a Rat without a tayle , Ile doe , Ile doe , and Ile doe 2 . *stop*
Ile giue thee a Winde 1 . *stop*
Th'art kinde 3 . *stop*
And I another 1 . *stop*
I my selfe haue all the other , And the very Ports they blow , All the Quarters that they know , I'th ' Ship-mans Card . *stop*
Ile dreyne him drie as Hay : Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day Hang vpon his Pent-house Lid : He shall liue a man forbid : Wearie Seu'nights , nine times nine , Shall he dwindle , peake , and pine : Though his Barke can not be lost , Yet it shall be Tempest-tost . *stop*
Looke what I haue 2 . *stop*
Shew me , shew me 1 . *stop*
Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe , Wrackt , as homeward he did come . *stop*
Drum within . *stop*
3 . *stop*
A Drumme , a Drumme : Macbeth doth come All . *stop*
The weyward Sisters , hand in hand , Posters of the Sea and Land , Thus doe goe , about , about , Thrice to thine , and thrice to mine , And thrice againe , to make vp nine . *stop*
Peace , the Charme 's wound vp . *stop*
Enter Macbeth and Banquo . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
So foule and faire a day I haue not seene Banquo . *stop*
How farre is't call 'd to Soris ? *stop*
What are these , So wither 'd , and so wilde in their attyre , That looke not like th ' Inhabitants o'th ' Earth , And yet are o n't ? *stop*
Liue you , or are you aught That man may question ? *stop*
you seeme to vnderstand me , By each at once her choppie finger laying Vpon her skinnie Lips : you should be Women , And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete That you are so Mac . *stop*
Speake if you can : what are you ? *stop*
1 . *stop*
All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Glamis 2 . *stop*
All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Cawdor 3 . *stop*
All haile Macbeth , that shalt be King hereafter Banq . *stop*
Good Sir , why doe you start , and seeme to feare Things that doe sound so faire ? *stop*
i'th ' name of truth Are ye fantasticall , or that indeed Which outwardly ye shew ? *stop*
My Noble Partner You greet with present Grace , and great prediction Of Noble hauing , and of Royall hope , That he seemes wrapt withall : to me you speake not . *stop*
If you can looke into the Seedes of Time , And say , which Graine will grow , and which will not , Speake then to me , who neyther begge , nor feare Your fauors , nor your hate 1 . *stop*
Hayle 2 . *stop*
Hayle 3 . *stop*
Hayle 1 . *stop*
Lesser than Macbeth , and greater 2 . *stop*
Not so happy , yet much happyer 3 . *stop*
Thou shalt get Kings , though thou be none : So all haile Macbeth , and Banquo 1 . *stop*
Banquo , and Macbeth , all haile Macb . *stop*
Stay you imperfect Speakers , tell me more : By Sinells death , I know I am Thane of Glamis , But how , of Cawdor ? *stop*
the Thane of Cawdor liues A prosperous Gentleman : And to be King , Stands not within the prospect of beleefe , No more then to be Cawdor . *stop*
Say from whence You owe this strange Intelligence , or why Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way With such Prophetique greeting ? *stop*
Speake , I charge you . *stop*
Witches vanish . *stop*
Banq . *stop*
The Earth hath bubbles , as the Water ha 's , And these are of them : whither are they vanish 'd ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Into the Ayre : and what seem 'd corporall , Melted , as breath into the Winde . *stop*
Would they had stay'd Banq . *stop*
Were such things here , as we doe speake about ? *stop*
Or haue we eaten on the insane Root , That takes the Reason Prisoner ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Your Children shall be Kings Banq . *stop*
You shall be King Macb . *stop*
And Thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ? *stop*
Banq . *stop*
Toth ' selfe-same tune and words : who 's here ? *stop*
Enter Rosse and Angus . *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
The King hath happily receiu 'd , Macbeth , The newes of thy successe : and when he reades Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight , His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend , Which should be thine , or his : silenc 'd with that , In viewing o 're the rest o'th ' selfe-same day , He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes , Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make Strange Images of death , as thick as Tale Can post with post , and euery one did beare Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence , And powr 'd them downe before him Ang . *stop*
Wee are sent , To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks , Onely to harrold thee into his sight , Not pay thee Rosse . *stop*
And for an earnest of a greater Honor , He bad me , from him , call thee Thane of Cawdor : In which addition , haile most worthy Thane , For it is thine Banq . *stop*
What , can the Deuill speake true ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
The Thane of Cawdor liues : Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes ? *stop*
Ang . *stop*
Who was the Thane , liues yet , But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life , Which he deserues to loose . *stop*
Whether he was combin 'd with those of Norway , Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe , And vantage ; or that with both he labour'd In his Countreyes wracke , I know not : But Treasons Capitall , confess 'd , and prou 'd , Haue ouerthrowne him Macb . *stop*
Glamys , and Thane of Cawdor : The greatest is behinde . *stop*
Thankes for your paines . *stop*
Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings , When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me , Promis 'd no lesse to them Banq . *stop*
That trusted home , Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne , Besides the Thane of Cawdor . *stop*
But 't is strange : And oftentimes , to winne vs to our harme , The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths , Winne vs with honest Trifles , to betray's In deepest consequence . *stop*
Cousins , a word , I pray you Macb . *stop*
Two Truths are told , As happy Prologues to the swelling Act Of the Imperiall Theame . *stop*
I thanke you Gentlemen : This supernaturall solliciting Can not be ill ; can not be good . *stop*
If ill ? *stop*
why hath it giuen me earnest of successe , Commencing in a Truth ? *stop*
I am Thane of Cawdor . *stop*
If good ? *stop*
why doe I yeeld to that suggestion , Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire , And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes , Against the vse of Nature ? *stop*
Present Feares Are lesse then horrible Imaginings : My Thought , whose Murther yet is but fantasticall , Shakes so my single state of Man , That Function is smother 'd in surmise , And nothing is , but what is not Banq . *stop*
Looke how our Partner 's rapt Macb . *stop*
If Chance will haue me King , Why Chance may Crowne me , Without my stirre Banq . *stop*
New Honors come vpon him Like our strange Garments , cleaue not to their mould , But with the aid of vse Macb . *stop*
Come what come may , Time , and the Houre , runs through the roughest Day Banq . *stop*
Worthy Macbeth , wee stay vpon your leysure Macb . *stop*
Giue me your fauour : My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten . *stop*
Kinde Gentlemen , your paines are registred , Where euery day I turne the Leafe , To reade them . *stop*
Let vs toward the King : thinke vpon What hath chanc 'd : and at more time , The Interim hauing weigh 'd it , let vs speake Our free Hearts each to other Banq . *stop*
Very gladly Macb . *stop*
Till then enough : Come friends . *stop*

King . *stop*
Is execution done on Cawdor ? *stop*
Or not those in Commission yet return 'd ? *stop*
Mal . *stop*
My Liege , they are not yet come back . *stop*
But I haue spoke with one that saw him die : Who did report , that very frankly hee Confess 'd his Treasons , implor 'd your Highnesse Pardon , And set forth a deepe Repentance : Nothing in his Life became him , Like the leauing it . *stop*
Hee dy'de , As one that had beene studied in his death , To throw away the dearest thing he ow 'd , As 'twere a carelesse Trifle King . *stop*
There 's no Art , To finde the Mindes construction in the Face . *stop*
He was a Gentleman , on whom I built An absolute Trust . *stop*
Enter Macbeth , Banquo , Rosse , and Angus . *stop*
O worthyest Cousin , The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now Was heauie on me . *stop*
Thou art so farre before , That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow , To ouertake thee . *stop*
Would thou hadst lesse deseru 'd , That the proportion both of thanks , and payment , Might haue beene mine : onely I haue left to say , More is thy due , then more then all can pay Macb . *stop*
The seruice , and the loyaltie I owe , In doing it , payes it selfe . *stop*
Your Highnesse part , is to receiue our Duties : And our Duties are to your Throne , and State , Children , and Seruants ; which doe but what they should , By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue And Honor King . *stop*
Welcome hither : I haue begun to plant thee , and will labour To make thee full of growing . *stop*
Noble Banquo , That hast no lesse deseru 'd , nor must be knowne No lesse to haue done so : Let me enfold thee , And hold thee to my Heart Banq . *stop*
There if I grow , The Haruest is your owne King . *stop*
My plenteous Ioyes , Wanton in fulnesse , seeke to hide themselues In drops of sorrow . *stop*
Sonnes , Kinsmen , Thanes , And you whose places are the nearest , know , We will establish our Estate vpon Our eldest , Malcolme , whom we name hereafter , The Prince of Cumberland : which Honor must Not vnaccompanied , inuest him onely , But signes of Noblenesse , like Starres , shall shine On all deseruers . *stop*
From hence to Envernes , And binde vs further to you Macb . *stop*
The Rest is Labor , which is not vs 'd for you : Ile be my selfe the Herbenger , and make ioyfull The hearing of my Wife , with your approach : So humbly take my leaue King . *stop*
My worthy Cawdor Macb . *stop*
The Prince of Cumberland : that is a step , On which I must fall downe , or else o're-leape , For in my way it lyes . *stop*
Starres hide your fires , Let not Light see my black and deepe desires : The Eye winke at the Hand : yet let that bee , Which the Eye feares , when it is done to see . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
King . *stop*
True worthy Banquo : he is full so valiant , And in his commendations , I am fed : It is a Banquet to me . *stop*
Let 's after him , Whose care is gone before , to bid vs welcome : It is a peerelesse Kinsman . *stop*
Flourish . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Quinta . *stop*
Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter . *stop*
Lady . *stop*
They met me in the day of successe : and I haue learn 'd by the perfect'st report , they haue more in them , then mortall knowledge . *stop*
When I burnt in desire to question them further , they made themselues Ayre , into which they vanish 'd . *stop*
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it , came Missiues from the King , who all-hail 'd me Thane of Cawdor , by which Title before , these weyward Sisters saluted me , and referr 'd me to the comming on of time , with haile King that shalt be . *stop*
This haue I thought good to deliuer thee ( my dearest Partner of Greatnesse ) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis 'd thee . *stop*
Lay it to thy heart and farewell . *stop*
Glamys thou art , and Cawdor , and shalt be What thou art promis 'd : yet doe I feare thy Nature , It is too full o'th ' Milke of humane kindnesse , To catch the neerest way . *stop*
Thou would'st be great , Art not without Ambition , but without The illnesse should attend it . *stop*
What thou would'st highly , That would'st thou holily : would'st not play false , And yet would'st wrongly winne . *stop*
Thould'st haue , great Glamys , that which cryes , Thus thou must doe , if thou haue it ; And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe , Then wishest should be vndone . *stop*
High thee hither , That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare , And chastise with the valour of my Tongue All that impeides thee from the Golden Round , Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme To haue thee crown 'd withall . *stop*
Enter Messenger . *stop*
What is your tidings ? *stop*
Mess . *stop*
The King comes here to Night Lady . *stop*
Thou'rt mad to say it . *stop*
Is not thy Master with him ? *stop*
who , wer't so , Would haue inform 'd for preparation Mess . *stop*
So please you , it is true : our Thane is comming : One of my fellowes had the speed of him ; Who almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Then would make vp his Message Lady . *stop*
Giue him tending , He brings great newes , Exit Messenger . *stop*
The Rauen himselfe is hoarse , That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan Vnder my Battlements . *stop*
Come you Spirits , That tend on mortall thoughts , vnsex me here , And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe , top-full Of direst Crueltie : make thick my blood , Stop vp th ' accesse , and passage to Remorse , That no compunctious visitings of Nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keepe peace betweene Th ' effect , and hit . *stop*
Come to my Womans Brests , And take my Milke for Gall , you murth'ring Ministers , Where-euer , in your sightlesse substances , You wait on Natures Mischiefe . *stop*
Come thick Night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell , That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes , Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke , To cry , hold , hold . *stop*
Enter Macbeth . *stop*
Great Glamys , worthy Cawdor , Greater then both , by the all-haile hereafter , Thy Letters haue transported me beyond This ignorant present , and I feele now The future in the instant Macb . *stop*
My dearest Loue , Duncan comes here to Night Lady . *stop*
And when goes hence ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
To morrow , as he purposes Lady . *stop*
O neuer , Shall Sunne that Morrow see . *stop*
Your Face , my Thane , is as a Booke , where men May reade strange matters , to beguile the time . *stop*
Looke like the time , beare welcome in your Eye , Your Hand , your Tongue : looke like th ' innocent flower , But be the Serpent vnder't . *stop*
He that 's comming , Must be prouided for : and you shall put This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch , Which shall to all our Nights , and Dayes to come , Giue solely soueraigne sway , and Masterdome Macb . *stop*
We will speake further , Lady . *stop*
Onely looke vp cleare : To alter fauor , euer is to feare : Leaue all the rest to me . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

Enter King , Malcolme , Donalbaine , Banquo , Lenox , Macduff , Rosse , Angus , and Attendants . *stop*
King . *stop*
This Castle hath a pleasant seat , The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe Vnto our gentle sences Banq . *stop*
This Guest of Summer , The Temple-haunting Barlet does approue , By his loued Mansonry , that the Heauens breath Smells wooingly here : no Iutty frieze , Buttrice , nor Coigne of Vantage , but this Bird Hath made his pendant Bed , and procreant Cradle , Where they must breed , and haunt : I haue obseru'd The ayre is delicate . *stop*
Enter Lady . *stop*
King . *stop*
See , see our honor 'd Hostesse : The Loue that followes vs , sometime is our trouble , Which still we thanke as Loue . *stop*
Herein I teach you , How you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines , And thanke vs for your trouble Lady . *stop*
All our seruice , In euery point twice done , and then done double , Were poore , and single Businesse , to contend Against those Honors deepe , and broad , Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House : For those of old , and the late Dignities , Heap 'd vp to them , we rest your Ermites King . *stop*
Where 's the Thane of Cawdor ? *stop*
We courst him at the heeles , and had a purpose To be his Purueyor : But he rides well , And his great Loue ( sharpe as his Spurre ) hath holp him To his home before vs : Faire and Noble Hostesse We are your guest to night La . *stop*
Your Seruants euer , Haue theirs , themselues , and what is theirs in compt , To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure , Still to returne your owne King . *stop*
Giue me your hand : Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly , And shall continue , our Graces towards him . *stop*
By your leaue Hostesse . *stop*

Enter a Sewer , and diuers Seruants with Dishes and Seruice ouer the Stage . *stop*
Then enter Macbeth Macb . *stop*
If it were done , when 't is done , then 'twer well , It were done quickly : If th ' Assassination Could trammell vp the Consequence , and catch With his surcease , Successe : that but this blow Might be the be all , and the end all . *stop*
Heere , But heere , vpon this Banke and Schoole of time , Wee'ld iumpe the life to come . *stop*
But in these Cases , We still haue iudgement heere , that we but teach Bloody Instructions , which being taught , returne To plague th ' Inuenter , this euen-handed Iustice Commends th ' Ingredience of our poyson 'd Challice To our owne lips . *stop*
Hee 's heere in double trust ; First , as I am his Kinsman , and his Subiect , Strong both against the Deed : Then , as his Host , Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore , Not beare the knife my selfe . *stop*
Besides , this Duncane Hath borne his Faculties so meeke ; hath bin So cleere in his great Office , that his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet-tongu 'd against The deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like a naked New-borne-Babe , Striding the blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors'd Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre , Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne the winde . *stop*
I haue no Spurre To pricke the sides of my intent , but onely Vaulting Ambition , which ore-leapes it selfe , And falles on th ' other . *stop*
Enter Lady . *stop*
How now ? *stop*
What Newes ? *stop*
La . *stop*
He has almost supt : why haue you left the chamber ? *stop*
Mac . *stop*
Hath he ask 'd for me ? *stop*
La . *stop*
Know you not , he ha 's ? *stop*
Mac . *stop*
We will proceed no further in this Businesse : He hath Honour 'd me of late , and I haue bought Golden Opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worne now in their newest glosse , Not cast aside so soone La . *stop*
Was the hope drunke , Wherein you drest your selfe ? *stop*
Hath it slept since ? *stop*
And wakes it now to looke so greene , and pale , At what it did so freely ? *stop*
From this time , Such I account thy loue . *stop*
Art thou affear'd To be the same in thine owne Act , and Valour , As thou art in desire ? *stop*
Would'st thou haue that Which thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life , And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme ? *stop*
Letting I dare not , wait vpon I would , Like the poore Cat i'th ' Addage Macb . *stop*
Prythee peace : I dare do all that may become a man , Who dares do more , is none La . *stop*
What Beast was't then That made you breake this enterprize to me ? *stop*
When you durst do it , then you were a man : And to be more then what you were , you would Be so much more the man . *stop*
Nor time , nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both : They haue made themselues , and that their fitnesse now Do 's vnmake you . *stop*
I haue giuen Sucke , and know How tender 't is to loue the Babe that milkes me , I would , while it was smyling in my Face , Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes , And dasht the Braines out , had I so sworne As you haue done to this Macb . *stop*
If we should faile ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
We faile ? *stop*
But screw your courage to the sticking place , And wee'le not fayle : when Duncan is asleepe , ( Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney Soundly inuite him ) his two Chamberlaines Will I with Wine , and Wassell , so conuince , That Memorie , the Warder of the Braine , Shall be a Fume , and the Receit of Reason A Lymbeck onely : when in Swinish sleepe , Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death , What can not you and I performe vpon Th ' vnguarded Duncan ? *stop*
What not put vpon His spungie Officers ? *stop*
who shall beare the guilt Of our great quell Macb . *stop*
Bring forth Men-Children onely : For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose Nothing but Males . *stop*
Will it not be receiu 'd , When we haue mark 'd with blood those sleepie two Of his owne Chamber , and vs 'd their very Daggers , That they haue do n't ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
Who dares receiue it other , As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore , Vpon his Death ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
I am settled , and bend vp Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat . *stop*
Away , and mock the time with fairest show , False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

How goes the Night , Boy ? *stop*
Fleance . *stop*
The Moone is downe : I haue not heard the Clock Banq . *stop*
And she goes downe at Twelue Fleance . *stop*
I take't , 't is later , Sir Banq . *stop*
Hold , take my Sword : There 's Husbandry in Heauen , Their Candles are all out : take thee that too . *stop*
A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me , And yet I would not sleepe : Mercifull Powers , restraine in me the cursed thoughts That Nature giues way to in repose . *stop*
Enter Macbeth , and a Seruant with a Torch . *stop*
Giue me my Sword : who 's there ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
A Friend Banq . *stop*
What Sir , not yet at rest ? *stop*
the King 's a bed . *stop*
He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure , And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices . *stop*
This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall , By the name of most kind Hostesse , And shut vp in measurelesse content Mac . *stop*
Being vnprepar 'd , Our will became the seruant to defect , Which else should free haue wrought Banq . *stop*
All 's well . *stop*
I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters : To you they haue shew 'd some truth Macb . *stop*
I thinke not of them : Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue , We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse , If you would graunt the time Banq . *stop*
At your kind'st leysure Macb . *stop*
If you shall cleaue to my consent , When 't is , it shall make Honor for you Banq . *stop*
So I lose none , In seeking to augment it , but still keepe My Bosome franchis 'd , and Allegeance cleare , I shall be counsail'd Macb . *stop*
Good repose the while Banq . *stop*
Thankes Sir : the like to you . *stop*

Come , let me clutch thee : I haue thee not , and yet I see thee still . *stop*
Art thou not fatall Vision , sensible To feeling , as to sight ? *stop*
or art thou but A Dagger of the Minde , a false Creation , Proceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine ? *stop*
I see thee yet , in forme as palpable , As this which now I draw . *stop*
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going , And such an Instrument I was to vse . *stop*
Mine Eyes are made the fooles o'th ' other Sences , Or else worth all the rest : I see thee still ; And on thy Blade , and Dudgeon , Gouts of Blood , Which was not so before . *stop*
There 's no such thing : It is the bloody Businesse , which informes Thus to mine Eyes . *stop*
Now o 're the one halfe World Nature seemes dead , and wicked Dreames abuse The Curtain 'd sleepe : Witchcraft celebrates Pale Heccats Offrings : and wither 'd Murther , Alarum 'd by his Centinell , the Wolfe , Whose howle 's his Watch , thus with his stealthy pace , With Tarquins rauishing sides , towards his designe Moues like a Ghost . *stop*
Thou sowre and firme-set Earth Heare not my steps , which they may walke , for feare Thy very stones prate of my where-about , And take the present horror from the time , Which now sutes with it . *stop*
Whiles I threat , he liues : Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues . *stop*
A Bell rings . *stop*
I goe , and it is done : the Bell inuites me . *stop*
Heare it not , Duncan , for it is a Knell , That summons thee to Heauen , or to Hell . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Scena Secunda . *stop*
Enter Lady . *stop*
La . *stop*
That which hath made the [ m ] drunk , hath made me bold : What hath quench 'd them , hath giuen me fire . *stop*
Hearke , peace : it was the Owle that shriek 'd , The fatall Bell-man , which giues the stern'st good-night . *stop*
He is about it , the Doores are open : And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge With Snores . *stop*
I haue drugg 'd their Possets , That Death and Nature doe contend about them , Whether they liue , or dye . *stop*
Enter Macbeth . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Who 's there ? *stop*
what hoa ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
Alack , I am afraid they haue awak 'd , And 't is not done : th ' attempt , and not the deed , Confounds vs : hearke : I lay 'd their Daggers ready , He could not misse 'em . *stop*
Had he not resembled My Father as he slept , I had do n't . *stop*
My Husband ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
I haue done the deed : Didst thou not heare a noyse ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
I heard the Owle schreame , and the Crickets cry . *stop*
Did not you speake ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
When ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
Now Macb . *stop*
As I descended ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
I Macb . *stop*
Hearke , who lyes i'th ' second Chamber ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
Donalbaine Mac . *stop*
This is a sorry sight Lady . *stop*
A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight Macb . *stop*
There 's one did laugh in 's sleepe , And one cry 'd Murther , that they did wake each other : I stood , and heard them : But they did say their Prayers , And addrest them againe to sleepe Lady . *stop*
There are two lodg 'd together Macb . *stop*
One cry 'd God blesse vs , and Amen the other , As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands : Listning their feare , I could not say Amen , When they did say God blesse vs Lady . *stop*
Consider it not so deepely Mac . *stop*
But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen ? *stop*
I had most need of Blessing , and Amen stuck in my throat Lady . *stop*
These deeds must not be thought After these wayes : so , it will make vs mad Macb . *stop*
Me thought I heard a voyce cry , Sleep no more : Macbeth does murther Sleepe , the innocent Sleepe , Sleepe that knits vp the rauel 'd Sleeue of Care , The death of each dayes Life , sore Labors Bath , Balme of hurt Mindes , great Natures second Course , Chiefe nourisher in Life 's Feast Lady . *stop*
What doe you meane ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Still it cry 'd , Sleepe no more to all the House : Glamis hath murther 'd Sleepe , and therefore Cawdor Shall sleepe no more : Macbeth shall sleepe no more Lady . *stop*
Who was it , that thus cry 'd ? *stop*
why worthy Thane , You doe vnbend your Noble strength , to thinke So braine-sickly of things : Goe get some Water , And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand . *stop*
Why did you bring these Daggers from the place ? *stop*
They must lye there : goe carry them , and smeare The sleepie Groomes with blood Macb . *stop*
Ile goe no more : I am afraid , to thinke what I haue done : Looke o n't againe , I dare not Lady . *stop*
Infirme of purpose : Giue me the Daggers : the sleeping , and the dead , Are but as Pictures : 't is the Eye of Childhood , That feares a painted Deuill . *stop*
If he doe bleed , Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall , For it must seeme their Guilt . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Knocke within . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Whence is that knocking ? *stop*
How is't with me , when euery noyse appalls me ? *stop*
What Hands are here ? *stop*
hah : they pluck out mine Eyes . *stop*
Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood Cleane from my Hand ? *stop*
no : this my Hand will rather The multitudinous Seas incarnardine , Making the Greene one , Red . *stop*
Enter Lady . *stop*
Lady . *stop*
My Hands are of your colour : but I shame To weare a Heart so white . *stop*
Knocke . *stop*
I heare a knocking at the South entry : Retyre we to our Chamber : A little Water cleares vs of this deed . *stop*
How easie is it then ? *stop*
your Constancie Hath left you vnattended . *stop*
Knocke . *stop*
Hearke , more knocking . *stop*
Get on your Night-Gowne , least occasion call vs , And shew vs to be Watchers : be not lost So poorely in your thoughts Macb . *stop*
To know my deed , Knocke . *stop*
'Twere best not know my selfe . *stop*
Wake Duncan with thy knocking : I would thou could'st . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Tertia . *stop*
Enter a Porter . *stop*
Knocking within . *stop*
Porter . *stop*
Here 's a knocking indeede : if a man were Porter of Hell Gate , hee should haue old turning the Key . *stop*
Knock . *stop*
Knock , Knock , Knock . *stop*
Who 's there i'th ' name of Belzebub ? *stop*
Here 's a Farmer , that hang'd himselfe on th ' expectation of Plentie : Come in time , haue Napkins enow about you , here you'le sweat for't . *stop*
Knock . *stop*
Knock , knock . *stop*
Who 's there in th ' other Deuils Name ? *stop*
Faith here 's an Equiuocator , that could sweare in both the Scales against eyther Scale , who committed Treason enough for Gods sake , yet could not equiuocate to Heauen : oh come in , Equiuocator . *stop*
Knock . *stop*
Knock , Knock , Knock . *stop*
Who 's there ? *stop*
'Faith here 's an English Taylor come hither , for stealing out of a French Hose : Come in Taylor , here you may rost your Goose . *stop*
Knock . *stop*
Knock , Knock . *stop*
Neuer at quiet : What are you ? *stop*
but this place is too cold for Hell . *stop*
Ile Deuill-Porter it no further : I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions , that goe the Primrose way to th ' euerlasting Bonfire . *stop*
Knock . *stop*
Anon , anon , I pray you remember the Porter . *stop*
Enter Macduff , and Lenox . *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Was it so late , friend , ere you went to Bed , That you doe lye so late ? *stop*
Port . *stop*
Faith Sir , we were carowsing till the second Cock : And Drinke , Sir , is a great prouoker of three things Macd . *stop*
What three things does Drinke especially prouoke ? *stop*
Port . *stop*
Marry , Sir , Nose-painting , Sleepe , and Vrine . *stop*
Lecherie , Sir , it prouokes , and vnprouokes : it prouokes the desire , but it takes away the performance . *stop*
Therefore much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie : it makes him , and it marres him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it perswades him , and dis-heartens him ; makes him stand too , and not stand too : in conclusion , equiuocates him in a sleepe , and giuing him the Lye , leaues him Macd . *stop*
I beleeue , Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night Port . *stop*
That it did , Sir , i'the very Throat on me : but I requited him for his Lye , and ( I thinke ) being too strong for him , though he tooke vp my Legges sometime , yet I made a Shift to cast him . *stop*
Enter Macbeth . *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Is thy Master stirring ? *stop*
Our knocking ha 's awak 'd him : here he comes Lenox . *stop*
Good morrow , Noble Sir Macb . *stop*
Good morrow both Macd . *stop*
Is the King stirring , worthy Thane ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Not yet Macd . *stop*
He did command me to call timely on him , I haue almost slipt the houre Macb . *stop*
Ile bring you to him Macd . *stop*
I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you : But yet 't is one Macb . *stop*
The labour we delight in , Physicks paine : This is the Doore Macd . *stop*
Ile make so bold to call , for 't is my limitted seruice . *stop*
Exit Macduffe . *stop*
Lenox . *stop*
Goes the King hence to day ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
He does : he did appoint so Lenox . *stop*
The Night ha 's been vnruly : Where we lay , our Chimneys were blowne downe , And ( as they say ) lamentings heard i'th ' Ayre ; Strange Schreemes of Death , And Prophecying , with Accents terrible , Of dyre Combustion , and confus 'd Euents , New hatch 'd toth ' wofull time . *stop*
The obscure Bird clamor 'd the liue-long Night . *stop*
Some say , the Earth was Feuorous , And did shake Macb . *stop*
'T was a rough Night Lenox . *stop*
My young remembrance can not paralell A fellow to it . *stop*
Enter Macduff . *stop*
Macd . *stop*
O horror , horror , horror , Tongue nor Heart can not conceiue , nor name thee Macb . *stop*
and Lenox . *stop*
What 's the matter ? *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Confusion now hath made his Master-peece : Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope The Lords anoynted Temple , and stole thence The Life o'th ' Building Macb . *stop*
What is't you say , the Life ? *stop*
Lenox . *stop*
Meane you his Maiestie ? *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Approch the Chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon . *stop*
Doe not bid me speake : See , and then speake your selues : awake , awake , Exeunt . *stop*
Macbeth and Lenox . *stop*
Ring the Alarum Bell : Murther , and Treason , Banquo , and Donalbaine : Malcolme awake , Shake off this Downey sleepe , Deaths counterfeit , And looke on Death it selfe : vp , vp , and see The great Doomes Image : Malcolme , Banquo , As from your Graues rise vp , and walke like Sprights , To countenance this horror . *stop*
Ring the Bell . *stop*
Bell rings . *stop*
Enter Lady . *stop*
Lady . *stop*
What 's the Businesse ? *stop*
That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the House ? *stop*
speake , speake Macd . *stop*
O gentle Lady , 'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake : The repetition in a Womans eare , Would murther as it fell . *stop*
Enter Banquo . *stop*
O Banquo , Banquo , Our Royall Master 's murther'd Lady . *stop*
Woe , alas : What , in our House ? *stop*
Ban . *stop*
Too cruell , any where . *stop*
Deare Duff , I prythee contradict thy selfe , And say , it is not so . *stop*
Enter Macbeth , Lenox , and Rosse . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Had I but dy 'd an houre before this chance , I had liu 'd a blessed time : for from this instant , There 's nothing serious in Mortalitie : All is but Toyes : Renowne and Grace is dead , The Wine of Life is drawne , and the meere Lees Is left this Vault , to brag of . *stop*
Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine . *stop*
Donal . *stop*
What is amisse ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
You are , and doe not know't : The Spring , the Head , the Fountaine of your Blood Is stopt , the very Source of it is stopt Macd . *stop*
Your Royall Father 's murther'd Mal . *stop*
Oh , by whom ? *stop*
Lenox . *stop*
Those of his Chamber , as it seem 'd , had do n't : Their Hands and Faces were all badg 'd with blood , So were their Daggers , which vnwip 'd , we found Vpon their Pillowes : they star 'd , and were distracted , No mans Life was to be trusted with them Macb . *stop*
O , yet I doe repent me of my furie , That I did kill them Macd . *stop*
Wherefore did you so ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Who can be wise , amaz 'd , temp'rate , & furious , Loyall , and Neutrall , in a moment ? *stop*
No man : Th ' expedition of my violent Loue Out-run the pawser , Reason . *stop*
Here lay Duncan , His Siluer skinne , lac 'd with His Golden Blood , And his gash 'd Stabs , look 'd like a Breach in Nature , For Ruines wastfull entrance : there the Murtherers , Steep 'd in the Colours of their Trade ; their Daggers Vnmannerly breech 'd with gore : who could refraine , That had a heart to loue ; and in that heart , Courage , to make 's loue knowne ? *stop*
Lady . *stop*
Helpe me hence , hoa Macd . *stop*
Looke to the Lady Mal . *stop*
Why doe we hold our tongues , That most may clayme this argument for ours ? *stop*
Donal . *stop*
What should be spoken here , Where our Fate hid in an augure hole , May rush , and seize vs ? *stop*
Let 's away , Our Teares are not yet brew'd Mal . *stop*
Nor our strong Sorrow Vpon the foot of Motion Banq . *stop*
Looke to the Lady : And when we haue our naked Frailties hid , That suffer in exposure ; let vs meet , And question this most bloody piece of worke , To know it further . *stop*
Feares and scruples shake vs : In the great Hand of God I stand , and thence , Against the vndivulg 'd pretence , I fight Of Treasonous Mallice Macd . *stop*
And so doe I All . *stop*
So all Macb . *stop*
Let 's briefely put on manly readinesse , And meet i'th ' Hall together All . *stop*
Well contented . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Malc . *stop*
What will you doe ? *stop*
Let 's not consort with them : To shew an vnfelt Sorrow , is an Office Which the false man do 's easie . *stop*
Ile to England Don . *stop*
To Ireland , I : Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer : Where we are , there 's Daggers in mens smiles ; The neere in blood , the neerer bloody Malc . *stop*
This murtherous Shaft that 's shot , Hath not yet lighted : and our safest way , Is to auoid the ayme . *stop*
Therefore to Horse , And let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking , But shift away : there 's warrant in that Theft , Which steales it selfe , when there 's no mercie left . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Quarta . *stop*
Enter Rosse , with an Old man . *stop*
Old man . *stop*
Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the Volume of which Time , I haue seene Houres dreadfull , and things strange : but this sore Night Hath trifled former knowings Rosse . *stop*
Ha , good Father , Thou seest the Heauens , as troubled with mans Act , Threatens his bloody Stage : byth ' Clock 't is Day , And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe : Is't Nights predominance , or the Dayes shame , That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe , When liuing Light should kisse it ? *stop*
Old man . *stop*
'T is vnnaturall , Euen like the deed that 's done : On Tuesday last , A Faulcon towring in her pride of place , Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at , and kill'd Rosse . *stop*
And Duncans Horses , ( A thing most strange , and certaine ) Beauteous , and swift , the Minions of their Race , Turn 'd wilde in nature , broke their stalls , flong out , Contending 'gainst Obedience , as they would Make Warre with Mankinde Old man . *stop*
'T is said , they eate each other Rosse . *stop*
They did so : To th ' amazement of mine eyes that look 'd vpo n't . *stop*
Enter Macduffe . *stop*
Heere comes the good Macduffe . *stop*
How goes the world Sir , now ? *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Why see you not ? *stop*
Ross . *stop*
Is't known who did this more then bloody deed ? *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Those that Macbeth hath slaine Ross . *stop*
Alas the day , What good could they pretend ? *stop*
Macd . *stop*
They were subborned , Malcolme , and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes Are stolne away and fled , which puts vpon them Suspition of the deed Rosse . *stop*
'Gainst Nature still , Thriftlesse Ambition , that will rauen vp Thine owne liues meanes : Then 't is most like , The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth Macd . *stop*
He is already nam 'd , and gone to Scone To be inuested Rosse . *stop*
Where is Duncans body ? *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Carried to Colmekill , The Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors , And Guardian of their Bones Rosse . *stop*
Will you to Scone ? *stop*

No Cosin , Ile to Fife Rosse . *stop*
Well , I will thither Macd . *stop*
Well may you see things wel done there : Adieu Least our old Robes sit easier then our new Rosse . *stop*
Farewell , Father Old M. Gods benyson go with you , and with those That would make good of bad , and Friends of Foes . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

Scena Prima . *stop*
Enter Banquo . *stop*
Banq . *stop*
Thou hast it now , King , Cawdor , Glamis , all , As the weyard Women promis 'd , and I feare Thou playd'st most fowly for't : yet it was saide It should not stand in thy Posterity , But that my selfe should be the Roote , and Father Of many Kings . *stop*
If there come truth from them , As vpon thee Macbeth , their Speeches shine , Why by the verities on thee made good , May they not be my Oracles as well , And set me vp in hope . *stop*
But hush , no more . *stop*
Senit sounded . *stop*
Enter Macbeth as King , Lady Lenox , Rosse , Lords , and Attendants . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Heere 's our chiefe Guest La . *stop*
If he had beene forgotten , It had bene as a gap in our great Feast , And all-thing vnbecomming Macb . *stop*
To night we hold a solemne Supper sir , And Ile request your presence Banq . *stop*
Let your Highnesse Command vpon me , to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tye For euer knit Macb . *stop*
Ride you this afternoone ? *stop*
Ban . *stop*
I , my good Lord Macb . *stop*
We should haue else desir 'd your good aduice ( Which still hath been both graue , and prosperous ) In this dayes Councell : but wee'le take to morrow . *stop*
Is't farre you ride ? *stop*
Ban . *stop*
As farre , my Lord , as will fill vp the time 'Twixt this , and Supper . *stop*
Goe not my Horse the better , I must become a borrower of the Night , For a darke houre , or twaine Macb . *stop*
Faile not our Feast Ban . *stop*
My Lord , I will not Macb . *stop*
We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd In England , and in Ireland , not confessing Their cruell Parricide , filling their hearers With strange inuention . *stop*
But of that to morrow , When therewithall , we shall haue cause of State , Crauing vs ioyntly . *stop*
Hye you to Horse : Adieu , till you returne at Night . *stop*
Goes Fleance with you ? *stop*

I , my good Lord : our time does call vpon's Macb . *stop*
I wish your Horses swift , and sure of foot : And so I doe commend you to their backs . *stop*
Farwell . *stop*
Exit Banquo . *stop*
Let euery man be master of his time , Till seuen at Night , to make societie The sweeter welcome : We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone : While then , God be with you . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Lords . *stop*
Sirrha , a word with you : Attend those men Our pleasure ? *stop*
Seruant . *stop*
They are , my Lord , without the Pallace Gate Macb . *stop*
Bring them before vs. Exit Seruant . *stop*
To be thus , is nothing , but to be safely thus Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe , And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that Which would be fear 'd . *stop*
'T is much he dares , And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde , He hath a Wisdome , that doth guide his Valour , To act in safetie . *stop*
There is none but he , Whose being I doe feare : and vnder him , My Genius is rebuk 'd , as it is said Mark Anthonies was by Caesar . *stop*
He chid the Sisters , When first they put the Name of King vpon me , And bad them speake to him . *stop*
Then Prophet-like , They hayl 'd him Father to a Line of Kings . *stop*
Vpon my Head they plac 'd a fruitlesse Crowne , And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe , Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand , No Sonne of mine succeeding : if't be so , For Banquo 's Issue haue I fil 'd my Minde , For them , the gracious Duncan haue I murther 'd , Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace Onely for them , and mine eternall Iewell Giuen to the common Enemie of Man , To make them Kings , the Seedes of Banquo Kings . *stop*
Rather then so , come Fate into the Lyst , And champion me to th ' vtterance . *stop*
Who 's there ? *stop*
Enter Seruant , and two Murtherers . *stop*
Now goe to the Doore , and stay there till we call . *stop*
Exit Seruant . *stop*
Was it not yesterday we spoke together ? *stop*
Murth . *stop*
It was , so please your Highnesse Macb . *stop*
Well then , Now haue you consider 'd of my speeches : Know , that it was he , in the times past , Which held you so vnder fortune , Which you thought had been our innocent selfe . *stop*
This I made good to you , in our last conference , Past in probation with you : How you were borne in hand , how crost : The Instruments : who wrought with them : And all things else , that might To halfe a Soule , and to a Notion craz 'd , Say , Thus did Banquo 1.Murth . *stop*
You made it knowne to vs Macb . *stop*
I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . *stop*
Doe you finde your patience so predominant , In your nature , that you can let this goe ? *stop*
Are you so Gospell 'd , to pray for this good man , And for his Issue , whose heauie hand Hath bow 'd you to the Graue , and begger'd Yours for euer ? *stop*
1.Murth . *stop*
We are men , my Liege Macb . *stop*
I , in the Catalogue ye goe for men , As Hounds , and Greyhounds , Mungrels , Spaniels , Curres , Showghes , Water-Rugs , and Demy-Wolues are clipt All by the Name of Dogges : the valued file Distinguishes the swift , the slow , the subtle , The House-keeper , the Hunter , euery one According to the gift , which bounteous Nature Hath in him clos 'd : whereby he does receiue Particular addition , from the Bill , That writes them all alike : and so of men . *stop*
Now , if you haue a station in the file , Not i'th ' worst ranke of Manhood , say't , And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes , Whose execution takes your Enemie off , Grapples you to the heart ; and loue of vs , Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life , Which in his Death were perfect 2.Murth . *stop*
I am one , my Liege , Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World Hath so incens 'd , that I am recklesse what I doe , To spight the World 1.Murth . *stop*
And I another , So wearie with Disasters , tugg 'd with Fortune , That I would set my Life on any Chance , To mend it , or be rid on't Macb . *stop*
Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie Murth . *stop*
True , my Lord Macb . *stop*
So is he mine : and in such bloody distance , That euery minute of his being , thrusts Against my neer'st of Life : and though I could With bare-fac 'd power sweepe him from my sight , And bid my will auouch it ; yet I must not , For certaine friends that are both his , and mine , Whose loues I may not drop , but wayle his fall , Who I my selfe struck downe : and thence it is , That I to your assistance doe make loue , Masking the Businesse from the common Eye , For sundry weightie Reasons 2.Murth . *stop*
We shall , my Lord , Performe what you command vs 1.Murth . *stop*
Though our Liues- Macb . *stop*
Your Spirits shine through you . *stop*
Within this houre , at most , I will aduise you where to plant your selues , Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th ' time , The moment o n't , for't must be done to Night , And something from the Pallace : alwayes thought , That I require a clearenesse ; and with him , To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke : Fleans , his Sonne , that keepes him companie , Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me , Then is his Fathers , must embrace the fate Of that darke houre : resolue your selues apart , Ile come to you anon Murth . *stop*
We are resolu 'd , my Lord Macb . *stop*
Ile call vpon you straight : abide within , It is concluded : Banquo , thy Soules flight , If it finde Heauen , must finde it out to Night . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

Enter Macbeths Lady , and a Seruant . *stop*
Lady . *stop*
Is Banquo gone from Court ? *stop*

Say to the King , I would attend his leysure , For a few words Seruant . *stop*
Madame , I will . *stop*
Enter . *stop*

Nought 's had , all 's spent . *stop*
Where our desire is got without content : 'Tis safer , to be that which we destroy , Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy . *stop*
Enter Macbeth . *stop*
How now , my Lord , why doe you keepe alone ? *stop*
Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making , Vsing those Thoughts , which should indeed haue dy'd With them they thinke on : things without all remedie Should be without regard : what 's done , is done Macb . *stop*
We haue scorch 'd the Snake , not kill 'd it : Shee'le close , and be her selfe , whilest our poore Mallice Remaines in danger of her former Tooth . *stop*
But let the frame of things dis-ioynt , Both the Worlds suffer , Ere we will eate our Meale in feare , and sleepe In the affliction of these terrible Dreames , That shake vs Nightly : Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gayne our peace , haue sent to peace , Then on the torture of the Minde to lye In restlesse extasie . *stop*
Duncane is in his Graue : After Lifes fitfull Feuer , he sleepes well , Treason ha 's done his worst : nor Steele , nor Poyson , Mallice domestique , forraine Leuie , nothing , Can touch him further Lady . *stop*
Come on : Gentle my Lord , sleeke o 're your rugged Lookes , Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night Macb . *stop*
So shall I Loue , and so I pray be you : Let your remembrance apply to Banquo , Present him Eminence , both with Eye and Tongue : Vnsafe the while , that wee must laue Our Honors in these flattering streames , And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts , Disguising what they are Lady . *stop*
You must leaue this Macb . *stop*
O , full of Scorpions is my Minde , deare Wife : Thou know'st , that Banquo and his Fleans liues Lady . *stop*
But in them , Natures Coppie 's not eterne Macb . *stop*
There 's comfort yet , they are assaileable , Then be thou iocund : ere the Bat hath flowne His Cloyster 'd flight , ere to black Heccats summons The shard-borne Beetle , with his drowsie hums , Hath rung Nights yawning Peale , There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note Lady . *stop*

Be innocent of the knowledge , dearest Chuck , Till thou applaud the deed : Come , seeling Night , Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day , And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond , Which keepes me pale . *stop*
Light thickens , And the Crow makes Wing toth ' Rookie Wood : Good things of Day begin to droope , and drowse , Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey 's doe rowse . *stop*
Thou maruell'st at my words : but hold thee still , Things bad begun , make strong themselues by ill : So prythee goe with me . *stop*

Macb . *stop*
You know your owne degrees , sit downe : At first and last , the hearty welcome Lords . *stop*
Thankes to your Maiesty Macb . *stop*
Our selfe will mingle with Society , And play the humble Host : Our Hostesse keepes her State , but in best time We will require her welcome La . *stop*
Pronounce it for me Sir , to all our Friends , For my heart speakes , they are welcome . *stop*
Enter first Murtherer . *stop*
Macb . *stop*

Is he dispatch 'd ? *stop*
Mur . *stop*
My Lord his throat is cut , that I did for him Mac . *stop*
Thou art the best o'th ' Cut-throats , Yet hee 's good that did the like for Fleans : If thou did'st it , thou art the Non-pareill Mur . *stop*
Most Royall Sir Fleans is scap'd Macb . *stop*
Then comes my Fit againe : I had else beene perfect ; Whole as the Marble , founded as the Rocke , As broad , and generall , as the casing Ayre : But now I am cabin 'd , crib 'd , confin 'd , bound in To sawcy doubts , and feares . *stop*
But Banquo 's safe ? *stop*
Mur . *stop*
I , my good Lord : safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head ; The least a Death to Nature Macb . *stop*
Thankes for that : There the growne Serpent lyes , the worme that 's fled Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed , No teeth for th ' present . *stop*
Get thee gone , to morrow Wee ' l heare our selues againe . *stop*
Exit Murderer . *stop*
Lady . *stop*
My Royall Lord , You do not giue the Cheere , the Feast is sold That is not often vouch 'd , while 't is a making : 'Tis giuen , with welcome : to feede were best at home : From thence , the sawce to meate is Ceremony , Meeting were bare without it . *stop*

Here had we now our Countries Honor , roof 'd , Were the grac 'd person of our Banquo present : Who , may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse , Then pitty for Mischance Rosse . *stop*
His absence ( Sir ) Layes blame vpon his promise . *stop*
Pleas't your Highnesse To grace vs with your Royall Company ? *stop*

What is't that moues your Highnesse ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Which of you haue done this ? *stop*
Lords . *stop*
What , my good Lord ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Thou canst not say I did it : neuer shake Thy goary lockes at me Rosse . *stop*
Gentlemen rise , his Highnesse is not well Lady . *stop*
Sit worthy Friends : my Lord is often thus , And hath beene from his youth . *stop*
Pray you keepe Seat , The fit is momentary , vpon a thought He will againe be well . *stop*
If much you note him You shall offend him , and extend his Passion , Feed , and regard him not . *stop*
Are you a man ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
I , and a bold one , that dare looke on that Which might appall the Diuell La . *stop*
O proper stuffe : This is the very painting of your feare : This is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said Led you to Duncan . *stop*
O , these flawes and starts ( Impostors to true feare ) would well become A womans story , at a Winters fire Authoriz 'd by her Grandam : shame it selfe , Why do you make such faces ? *stop*
When all 's done You looke but on a stoole Macb . *stop*
Prythee see there : Behold , looke , loe , how say you : Why what care I , if thou canst nod , speake too . *stop*
If Charnell houses , and our Graues must send Those that we bury , backe ; our Monuments Shall be the Mawes of Kytes La . *stop*
What ? *stop*
quite vnmann 'd in folly Macb . *stop*
If I stand heere , I saw him La . *stop*
Fie for shame Macb . *stop*
Blood hath bene shed ere now , i'th ' olden time Ere humane Statute purg 'd the gentle Weale : I , and since too , Murthers haue bene perform'd Too terrible for the eare . *stop*
The times has bene , That when the Braines were out , the man would dye , And there an end : But now they rise againe With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes , And push vs from our stooles . *stop*
This is more strange Then such a murther is La . *stop*
My worthy Lord Your Noble Friends do lacke you Macb . *stop*
I do forget : Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends , I haue a strange infirmity , which is nothing To those that know me . *stop*
Come , loue and health to all , Then Ile sit downe : Giue me some Wine , fill full : Enter Ghost . *stop*

Auant , & quit my sight , let the earth hide thee : Thy bones are marrowlesse , thy blood is cold : Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with La . *stop*
Thinke of this good Peeres But as a thing of Custome : 'T is no other , Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time Macb . *stop*
What man dare , I dare : Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare , The arm 'd Rhinoceros , or th ' Hircan Tiger , Take any shape but that , and my firme Nerues Shall neuer tremble . *stop*
Or be aliue againe , And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword : If trembling I inhabit then , protest mee The Baby of a Girle . *stop*
Hence horrible shadow , Vnreall mock'ry hence . *stop*
Why so , being gone I am a man againe : pray you sit still La . *stop*
You haue displac 'd the mirth , Broke the good meeting , with most admir 'd disorder Macb . *stop*
Can such things be , And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd , Without our speciall wonder ? *stop*
You make me strange Euen to the disposition that I owe , When now I thinke you can behold such sights , And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes , When mine is blanch 'd with feare Rosse . *stop*
What sights , my Lord ? *stop*
La . *stop*
I pray you speake not : he growes worse & worse Question enrages him : at once , goodnight . *stop*
Stand not vpon the order of your going , But go at once Len . *stop*
Good night , and better health Attend his Maiesty La . *stop*
A kinde goodnight to all . *stop*
Exit Lords . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
It will haue blood they say : Blood will haue Blood : Stones haue beene knowne to moue , & Trees to speake : Augures , and vnderstood Relations , haue By Maggot Pyes , & Choughes , & Rookes brought forth The secret'st man of Blood . *stop*
What is the night ? *stop*
La . *stop*
Almost at oddes with morning , which is which Macb . *stop*
How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding La . *stop*
Did you send to him Sir ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
I heare it by the way : But I will send : There 's not a one of them but in his house I keepe a Seruant Feed . *stop*
I will to morrow ( And betimes I will ) to the weyard Sisters . *stop*
More shall they speake : for now I am bent to know By the worst meanes , the worst , for mine owne good , All causes shall giue way . *stop*
I am in blood Stept in so farre , that should I wade no more , Returning were as tedious as go ore : Strange things I haue in head , that will to hand , Which must be acted , ere they may be scand La . *stop*
You lacke the season of all Natures , sleepe Macb . *stop*
Come , wee ' l to sleepe : My strange & self-abuse Is the initiate feare , that wants hard vse : We are yet but yong indeed . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Quinta . *stop*

Enter the three Witches , meeting Hecat . *stop*
1 . *stop*
Why how now Hecat , you looke angerly ? *stop*
Hec . *stop*
Haue I not reason ( Beldams ) as you are ? *stop*
Sawcy , and ouer-bold , how did you dare To Trade , and Trafficke with Macbeth , In Riddles , and Affaires of death ; And I the Mistris of your Charmes , The close contriuer of all harmes , Was neuer call 'd to beare my part , Or shew the glory of our Art ? *stop*
And which is worse , all you haue done Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne , Spightfull , and wrathfull , who ( as others do ) Loues for his owne ends , not for you . *stop*
But make amends now : Get you gon , And at the pit of Acheron Meete me i'th ' Morning : thither he Will come , to know his Destinie . *stop*
Your Vessels , and your Spels prouide , Your Charmes , and euery thing beside ; I am for th ' Ayre : This night Ile spend Vnto a dismall , and a Fatall end . *stop*
Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone . *stop*
Vpon the Corner of the Moone There hangs a vap'rous drop , profound , Ile catch it ere it come to ground ; And that distill 'd by Magicke slights , Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights , As by the strength of their illusion , Shall draw him on to his Confusion . *stop*
He shall spurne Fate , scorne Death , and beare His hopes 'boue Wisedome , Grace , and Feare : And you all know , Security Is Mortals cheefest Enemie . *stop*
Musicke , and a Song . *stop*
Hearke , I am call 'd : my little Spirit see Sits in Foggy cloud , and stayes for me . *stop*

Exeunt . *stop*
Scaena Sexta . *stop*
Enter Lenox , and another Lord . *stop*
Lenox . *stop*
My former Speeches , Haue but hit your Thoughts Which can interpret farther : Onely I say Things haue bin strangely borne . *stop*
The gracious Duncan Was pittied of Macbeth : marry he was dead : And the right valiant Banquo walk 'd too late , Whom you may say ( if't please you ) Fleans kill 'd , For Fleans fled : Men must not walke too late . *stop*
Who can not want the thought , how monstrous It was for Malcolme , and for Donalbane To kill their gracious Father ? *stop*
Damned Fact , How it did greeue Macbeth ? *stop*
Did he not straight In pious rage , the two delinquents teare , That were the Slaues of drinke , and thralles of sleepe ? *stop*
Was not that Nobly done ? *stop*
I , and wisely too : For 'twould haue anger 'd any heart aliue To heare the men deny't . *stop*
So that I say , He ha 's borne all things well , and I do thinke , That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key , ( As , and't please Heauen he shall not ) they should finde What 'twere to kill a Father : So should Fleans . *stop*
But peace ; for from broad words , and cause he fayl'd His presence at the Tyrants Feast , I heare Macduffe liues in disgrace . *stop*
Sir , can you tell Where he bestowes himselfe ? *stop*
Lord . *stop*
The Sonnes of Duncane ( From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth ) Liues in the English Court , and is receyu'd Of the most Pious Edward , with such grace , That the maleuolence of Fortune , nothing Takes from his high respect . *stop*
Thither Macduffe Is gone , to pray the Holy King , vpon his ayd To wake Northumberland , and warlike Seyward , That by the helpe of these ( with him aboue ) To ratifie the Worke ) we may againe Giue to our Tables meate , sleepe to our Nights : Free from our Feasts , and Banquets bloody kniues ; Do faithfull Homage , and receiue free Honors , All which we pine for now . *stop*
And this report Hath so exasperate their King , that hee Prepares for some attempt of Warre Len . *stop*
Sent he to Macduffe ? *stop*
Lord . *stop*
He did : and with an absolute Sir , not I The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe , And hums ; as who should say , you ' l rue the time That clogges me with this Answer Lenox . *stop*
And that well might Aduise him to a Caution , t ' hold what distance His wisedome can prouide . *stop*
Some holy Angell Flye to the Court of England , and vnfold His Message ere he come , that a swift blessing May soone returne to this our suffering Country , Vnder a hand accurs'd Lord . *stop*
Ile send my Prayers with him . *stop*

A deed without a name Macb . *stop*
I coniure you , by that which you Professe , ( How ere you come to know it ) answer me : Though you vntye the Windes , and let them fight Against the Churches : Though the yesty Waues Confound and swallow Nauigation vp : Though bladed Corne be lodg 'd , & Trees blown downe , Though Castles topple on their Warders heads : Though Pallaces , and Pyramids do slope Their heads to their Foundations : Though the treasure Of Natures Germaine , tumble altogether , Euen till destruction sicken : Answer me To what I aske you 1 Speake 2 Demand 3 Wee ' l answer 1 Say , if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes , Or from our Masters Macb . *stop*
Call 'em : let me see 'em 1 Powre in Sowes blood , that hath eaten Her nine Farrow : Greaze that 's sweaten From the Murderers Gibbet , throw Into the Flame All . *stop*

Be Lyon metled , proud , and take no care : Who chafes , who frets , or where Conspirers are : Macbeth shall neuer vanquish 'd be , vntill Great Byrnam Wood , to high Dunsmane Hill Shall come against him . *stop*
Descend . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
That will neuer bee : Who can impresse the Forrest , bid the Tree Vnfixe his earth-bound Root ? *stop*
Sweet boadments , good : Rebellious dead , rise neuer till the Wood Of Byrnan rise , and our high plac 'd Macbeth Shall liue the Lease of Nature , pay his breath To time , and mortall Custome . *stop*

Start eyes ! *stop*
What will the Line stretch out to'th ' cracke of Doome ? *stop*
Another yet ? *stop*
A seauenth ? *stop*

From this moment , The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand . *stop*
And euen now To Crown my thoughts with Acts : be it thoght & done : The Castle of Macduff , I will surprize . *stop*
Seize vpon Fife ; giue to th ' edge o'th ' Sword His Wife , his Babes , and all vnfortunate Soules That trace him in his Line . *stop*

Wife . *stop*
What had he done , to make him fly the Land ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
You must haue patience Madam Wife . *stop*
He had none : His flight was madnesse : when our Actions do not , Our feares do make vs Traitors Rosse . *stop*
You know not Whether it was his wisedome , or his feare Wife . *stop*
Wisedom ? *stop*
to leaue his wife , to leaue his Babes , His Mansion , and his Titles , in a place From whence himselfe do 's flye ? *stop*
He loues vs not , He wants the naturall touch . *stop*
For the poore Wren ( The most diminitiue of Birds ) will fight , Her yong ones in her Nest , against the Owle : All is the Feare , and nothing is the Loue ; As little is the Wisedome , where the flight So runnes against all reason Rosse . *stop*
My deerest Cooz , I pray you schoole your selfe . *stop*
But for your Husband , He is Noble , Wise , Iudicious , and best knowes The fits o'th ' Season . *stop*
I dare not speake much further , But cruell are the times , when we are Traitors And do not know our selues : when we hold Rumor From what we feare , yet know not what we feare , But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea Each way , and moue . *stop*
I take my leaue of you : Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe : Things at the worst will cease , or else climbe vpward , To what they were before . *stop*

Poore Birds they are not set for : My Father is not dead for all your saying Wife . *stop*
Yes , he is dead : How wilt thou do for a Father ? *stop*
Son . *stop*
Nay how will you do for a Husband ? *stop*

Why I can buy me twenty at any Market Son . *stop*

What is a Traitor ? *stop*

Why one that sweares , and lyes Son . *stop*

Euery one that do 's so , is a Traitor , And must be hang'd Son . *stop*
And must they all be hang 'd , that swear and lye ? *stop*
Wife . *stop*
Euery one Son . *stop*
Who must hang them ? *stop*
Wife . *stop*
Why , the honest men Son . *stop*
Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools : for there are Lyars and Swearers enow , to beate the honest men , and hang vp them Wife . *stop*
Now God helpe thee , poore Monkie : But how wilt thou do for a Father ? *stop*

Blesse you faire Dame : I am not to you known , Though in your state of Honor I am perfect ; I doubt some danger do 's approach you neerely . *stop*
If you will take a homely mans aduice , Be not found heere : Hence with your little ones To fright you thus . *stop*

Heauen preserue you , I dare abide no longer . *stop*
Exit Messenger Wife . *stop*
Whether should I flye ? *stop*
I haue done no harme . *stop*
But I remember now I am in this earthly world : where to do harme Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly . *stop*
Why then ( alas ) Do I put vp that womanly defence , To say I haue done no harme ? *stop*
What are these faces ? *stop*
Enter Murtherers . *stop*

I hope in no place so vnsanctified , Where such as thou may'st finde him Mur . *stop*
He 's a Traitor Son . *stop*
Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear 'd Villaine Mur . *stop*
What you Egge ? *stop*
Yong fry of Treachery ? *stop*
Son . *stop*
He ha 's kill 'd me Mother , Run away I pray you . *stop*
Exit crying Murther . *stop*
Scaena Tertia . *stop*
Enter Malcolme and Macduffe . *stop*
Mal . *stop*
Let vs seeke out some desolate shade , & there Weepe our sad bosomes empty Macd . *stop*
Let vs rather Hold fast the mortall Sword : and like good men , Bestride our downfall Birthdome : each new Morne , New Widdowes howle , new Orphans cry , new sorowes Strike heauen on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland , and yell 'd out Like Syllable of Dolour Mal . *stop*
What I beleeue , Ile waile ; What know , beleeue ; and what I can redresse , As I shall finde the time to friend : I wil . *stop*
What you haue spoke , it may be so perchance . *stop*
This Tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest : you haue lou 'd him well , He hath not touch 'd you yet . *stop*
I am yong , but something You may discerne of him through me , and wisedome To offer vp a weake , poore innocent Lambe T ' appease an angry God Macd . *stop*
I am not treacherous Malc . *stop*
But Macbeth is . *stop*
A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle In an Imperiall charge . *stop*
But I shall craue your pardon : That which you are , my thoughts can not transpose ; Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell . *stop*
Though all things foule , would wear the brows of grace Yet Grace must still looke so Macd . *stop*
I haue lost my Hopes Malc . *stop*
Perchance euen there Where I did finde my doubts . *stop*
Why in that rawnesse left you Wife , and Childe ? *stop*
Those precious Motiues , those strong knots of Loue , Without leaue-taking . *stop*
I pray you , Let not my Iealousies , be your Dishonors , But mine owne Safeties : you may be rightly iust , What euer I shall thinke Macd . *stop*
Bleed , bleed poore Country , Great Tyrrany , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodnesse dare not check thee : wear y thy wrongs , The Title , is affear 'd . *stop*
Far thee well Lord , I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st , For the whole Space that 's in the Tyrants Graspe , And the rich East to boot Mal . *stop*
Be not offended : I speake not as in absolute feare of you : I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake , It weepes , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds . *stop*
I thinke withall , There would be hands vplifted in my right : And heere from gracious England haue I offer Of goodly thousands . *stop*
But for all this , When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head , Or weare it on my Sword ; yet my poore Country Shall haue more vices then it had before , More suffer , and more sundry wayes then euer , By him that shall succeede Macd . *stop*
What should he be ? *stop*
Mal . *stop*
It is my selfe I meane : in whom I know All the particulars of Vice so grafted , That when they shall be open 'd , blacke Macbeth Will seeme as pure as Snow , and the poore State Esteeme him as a Lambe , being compar'd With my confinelesse harmes Macd . *stop*
Not in the Legions Of horrid Hell , can come a Diuell more damn'd In euils , to top Macbeth Mal . *stop*
I grant him Bloody , Luxurious , Auaricious , False , Deceitfull , Sodaine , Malicious , smacking of euery sinne That ha 's a name . *stop*
But there 's no bottome , none In my Voluptuousnesse : Your Wiues , your Daughters , Your Matrons , and your Maides , could not fill vp The Cesterne of my Lust , and my Desire All continent Impediments would ore-beare That did oppose my will . *stop*
Better Macbeth , Then such an one to reigne Macd . *stop*
Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is a Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne , And fall of many Kings . *stop*
But feare not yet To take vpon you what is yours : you may Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , And yet seeme cold . *stop*
The time you may so hoodwinke : We haue willing Dames enough : there can not be That Vulture in you , to deuoure so many As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues , Finding it so inclinde Mal . *stop*
With this , there growes In my most ill-composd Affection , such A stanchlesse Auarice , that were I King , I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands , Desire his Iewels , and this others House , And my more-hauing , would be as a Sawce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall , Destroying them for wealth Macd . *stop*
This Auarice stickes deeper : growes with more pernicious roote Then Summer-seeming Lust : and it hath bin The Sword of our slaine Kings : yet do not feare , Scotland hath Foysons , to fill vp your will Of your meere Owne . *stop*
All these are portable , With other Graces weigh'd Mal . *stop*
But I haue none . *stop*
The King-becoming Graces , As Iustice , Verity , Temp'rance , Stablenesse , Bounty , Perseuerance , Mercy , Lowlinesse , Deuotion , Patience , Courage , Fortitude , I haue no rellish of them , but abound In the diuision of each seuerall Crime , Acting it many wayes . *stop*
Nay , had I powre , I should Poure the sweet Milke of Concord , into Hell , Vprore the vniuersall peace , confound All vnity on earth Macd . *stop*
O Scotland , Scotland Mal . *stop*
If such a one be fit to gouerne , speake : I am as I haue spoken Mac . *stop*
Fit to gouern ? *stop*
No not to liue . *stop*
O Natio [ n ] miserable ! *stop*
With an vntitled Tyrant , bloody Sceptred , When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe ? *stop*
Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne By his owne Interdiction stands accust , And do 's blaspheme his breed ? *stop*
Thy Royall Father Was a most Sainted-King : the Queene that bore thee , Oftner vpon her knees , then on her feet , Dy'de euery day she liu 'd . *stop*
Fare thee well , These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe , Hath banish 'd me from Scotland . *stop*
O my Brest , Thy hope ends heere Mal . *stop*
Macduff , this Noble passion Childe of integrity , hath from my soule Wip 'd the blacke Scruples , reconcil 'd my thoughts To thy good Truth , and Honor . *stop*
Diuellish Macbeth , By many of these traines , hath sought to win me Into his power : and modest Wisedome pluckes me From ouer-credulous hast : but God aboue Deale betweene thee and me ; For euen now I put my selfe to thy Direction , and Vnspeake mine owne detraction . *stop*
Heere abiure The taints , and blames I laide vpon my selfe , For strangers to my Nature . *stop*
I am yet Vnknowne to Woman , neuer was forsworne , Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne . *stop*
At no time broke my Faith , would not betray The Deuill to his Fellow , and delight No lesse in truth then life . *stop*
My first false speaking Was this vpon my selfe . *stop*
What I am truly Is thine , and my poore Countries to command : Whither indeed , before they heere approach Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point , was setting foorth : Now wee ' l together , and the chance of goodnesse Be like our warranted Quarrell . *stop*
Why are you silent ? *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Such welcome , and vnwelcom things at once 'Tis hard to reconcile . *stop*
Enter a Doctor . *stop*

Well , more anon . *stop*
Comes the King forth I pray you ? *stop*
Doct . *stop*

I thanke you Doctor Macd . *stop*
What 's the Disease he meanes ? *stop*
Mal . *stop*
Tis call 'd the Euill . *stop*
A most myraculous worke in this good King , Which often since my heere remaine in England , I haue seene him do : How he solicites heauen Himselfe best knowes : but strangely visited people All swolne and Vlcerous , pittifull to the eye , The meere dispaire of Surgery , he cures , Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes , Put on with holy Prayers , and 't is spoken To the succeeding Royalty he leaues The healing Benediction . *stop*
With this strange vertue , He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie , And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne , That speake him full of Grace . *stop*
Enter Rosse . *stop*

Good God betimes remoue The meanes that makes vs Strangers Rosse . *stop*
Sir , Amen Macd . *stop*
Stands Scotland where it did ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
Alas poore Countrey , Almost affraid to know it selfe . *stop*
It can not Be call 'd our Mother , but our Graue ; where nothing But who knowes nothing , is once seene to smile : Where sighes , and groanes , and shrieks that rent the ayre Are made , not mark 'd : Where violent sorrow seemes A Moderne extasie : The Deadmans knell , Is there scarse ask 'd for who , and good mens liues Expire before the Flowers in their Caps , Dying , or ere they sicken Macd . *stop*
Oh Relation ; too nice , and yet too true Malc . *stop*
What 's the newest griefe ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
That of an houres age , doth hisse the speaker , Each minute teemes a new one Macd . *stop*
How do 's my Wife ? *stop*

Rosse . *stop*
No , they were wel at peace , when I did leaue 'em Macd . *stop*
Be not a niggard of your speech : How gos't ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
When I came hither to transport the Tydings Which I haue heauily borne , there ran a Rumour Of many worthy Fellowes , that were out , Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather , For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot . *stop*
Now is the time of helpe : your eye in Scotland Would create Soldiours , make our women fight , To doffe their dire distresses Malc . *stop*
Bee't their comfort We are comming thither : Gracious England hath Lent vs good Seyward , and ten thousand men , An older , and a better Souldier , none That Christendome giues out Rosse . *stop*
Would I could answer This comfort with the like . *stop*
But I haue words That would be howl 'd out in the desert ayre , Where hearing should not latch them Macd . *stop*
What concerne they , The generall cause , or is it a Fee-griefe Due to some single brest ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
No minde that 's honest But in it shares some woe , though the maine part Pertaines to you alone Macd . *stop*
If it be mine Keepe it not from me , quickly let me haue it Rosse . *stop*
Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer , Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound that euer yet they heard Macd . *stop*
Humh : I guesse at it Rosse . *stop*
Your Castle is surpriz 'd : your Wife , and Babes Sauagely slaughter 'd : To relate the manner Were on the Quarry of these murther 'd Deere To adde the death of you Malc . *stop*
Mercifull Heauen : What man , ne 're pull your hat vpon your browes : Giue sorrow words ; the griefe that do 's not speake , Whispers the o're-fraught heart , and bids it breake Macd . *stop*
My Children too ? *stop*

And I must be from thence ? *stop*
My wife kil 'd too ? *stop*

Be comforted . *stop*
Let 's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge , To cure this deadly greefe Macd . *stop*
He ha 's no Children . *stop*
All my pretty ones ? *stop*
Did you say All ? *stop*
Oh Hell-Kite ! *stop*
All ? *stop*
What , All my pretty Chickens , and their Damme At one fell swoope ? *stop*
Malc . *stop*
Dispute it like a man Macd . *stop*
I shall do so : But I must also feele it as a man ; I can not but remember such things were That were most precious to me : Did heauen looke on , And would not take their part ? *stop*
Sinfull Macduff , They were all strooke for thee : Naught that I am , Not for their owne demerits , but for mine Fell slaughter on their soules : Heauen rest them now Mal . *stop*
Be this the Whetstone of your sword , let griefe Conuert to anger : blunt not the heart , enrage it Macd . *stop*
O I could play the woman with mine eyes , And Braggart with my tongue . *stop*
But gentle Heauens , Cut short all intermission : Front to Front , Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland , and my selfe Within my Swords length set him , if he scape Heauen forgiue him too Mal . *stop*
This time goes manly : Come go we to the King , our Power is ready , Our lacke is nothing but our leaue . *stop*

Since his Maiesty went into the Field , I haue seene her rise from her bed , throw her Night-Gown vppon her , vnlocke her Closset , take foorth paper , folde it , write vpo n't , read it , afterwards Seale it , and againe returne to bed ; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe Doct . *stop*
A great perturbation in Nature , to receyue at once the benefit of sleep , and do the effects of watching . *stop*
In this slumbry agitation , besides her walking , and other actuall performances , what ( at any time ) haue you heard her say ? *stop*
Gent . *stop*

You may to me , and 't is most meet you should Gent . *stop*

What is it she do 's now ? *stop*
Looke how she rubbes her hands Gent . *stop*
It is an accustom 'd action with her , to seeme thus washing her hands : I haue knowne her continue in this a quarter of an houre Lad . *stop*
Yet heere 's a spot Doct . *stop*
Heark , she speaks , I will set downe what comes from her , to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly La . *stop*

Do you marke that ? *stop*

The Thane of Fife , had a wife : where is she now ? *stop*
What will these hands ne 're be cleane ? *stop*
No more o'that my Lord , no more o'that : you marre all with this starting Doct . *stop*
Go too , go too : You haue knowne what you should not Gent . *stop*
She ha 's spoke what shee should not , I am sure of that : Heauen knowes what she ha 's knowne La . *stop*
Heere 's the smell of the blood still : all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . *stop*
Oh , oh , oh Doct . *stop*
What a sigh is there ? *stop*
The hart is sorely charg'd Gent . *stop*
I would not haue such a heart in my bosome , for the dignity of the whole body Doct . *stop*
Well , well , well Gent . *stop*
Pray God it be sir Doct . *stop*
This disease is beyond my practise : yet I haue knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep , who haue dyed holily in their beds Lad . *stop*
Wash your hands , put on your Night-Gowne , looke not so pale : I tell you yet againe Banquo 's buried ; he can not come out on 's graue Doct . *stop*
Euen so ? *stop*

To bed , to bed , to bed . *stop*
Exit Lady . *stop*
Doct . *stop*
Will she go now to bed ? *stop*
Gent . *stop*
Directly Doct . *stop*
Foule whisp'rings are abroad : vnnaturall deeds Do breed vnnaturall troubles : infected mindes To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets : More needs she the Diuine , then the Physitian : God , God forgiue vs all . *stop*
Looke after her , Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance , And still keepe eyes vpon her : So goodnight , My minde she ha 's mated , and amaz 'd my sight . *stop*

For certaine Sir , he is not : I haue a File Of all the Gentry ; there is Seywards Sonne , And many vnruffe youths , that euen now Protest their first of Manhood Ment . *stop*
What do 's the Tyrant Cath . *stop*
Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies : Some say hee 's mad : Others , that lesser hate him , Do call it valiant Fury , but for certaine He can not buckle his distemper 'd cause Within the belt of Rule Ang . *stop*
Now do 's he feele His secret Murthers sticking on his hands , Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach : Those he commands , moue onely in command , Nothing in loue : Now do 's he feele his Title Hang loose about him , like a Giants Robe Vpon a dwarfish Theefe Ment . *stop*
Who then shall blame His pester 'd Senses to recoyle , and start , When all that is within him , do 's condemne It selfe , for being there Cath . *stop*
Well , march we on , To giue Obedience , where 't is truly ow 'd : Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale , And with him poure we in our Countries purge , Each drop of vs Lenox . *stop*

What 's the Boy Malcolme ? *stop*
Was he not borne of woman ? *stop*
The Spirits that know All mortall Consequences , haue pronounc 'd me thus : Feare not Macbeth , no man that 's borne of woman Shall ere haue power vpon thee . *stop*
Then fly false Thanes , And mingle with the English Epicures , The minde I sway by , and the heart I beare , Shall neuer sagge with doubt , nor shake with feare . *stop*

Cure of that : Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas 'd , Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow , Raze out the written troubles of the Braine , And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote Cleanse the stufft bosome , of that perillous stuffe Which weighes vpon the heart ? *stop*
Doct . *stop*
Therein the Patient Must minister to himselfe Macb . *stop*
Throw Physicke to the Dogs , Ile none of it . *stop*

What is that noyse ? *stop*
A Cry within of Women . *stop*
Sey . *stop*
It is the cry of women , my good Lord Macb . *stop*
I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares : The time ha 's beene , my sences would haue cool'd To heare a Night-shrieke , and my Fell of haire Would at a dismall Treatise rowze , and stirre As life were i n't . *stop*
I haue supt full with horrors , Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Can not once start me . *stop*
Wherefore was that cry ? *stop*
Sey . *stop*
The Queene ( my Lord ) is dead Macb . *stop*
She should haue dy'de heereafter ; There would haue beene a time for such a word : To morrow , and to morrow , and to morrow , Creepes in this petty pace from day to day , To the last Syllable of Recorded time : And all our yesterdayes , haue lighted Fooles The way to dusty death . *stop*
Out , out , breefe Candle , Life 's but a walking Shadow , a poore Player , That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage , And then is heard no more . *stop*
It is a Tale Told by an Ideot , full of sound and fury Signifying nothing . *stop*

Such a one Am I to feare , or none . *stop*
Enter young Seyward . *stop*
Y.Sey . *stop*
What is thy name ? *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Thou'lt be affraid to heare it Y.Sey . *stop*
No : though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name Then any is in hell Macb . *stop*
My name 's Macbeth Y.Sey . *stop*
The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title More hatefull to mine eare Macb . *stop*
No : nor more fearefull Y.Sey . *stop*
Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant , with my Sword Ile proue the lye thou speak'st . *stop*
Fight , and young Seyward slaine . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Thou was't borne of woman ; But Swords I smile at , Weapons laugh to scorne , Brandish 'd by man that 's of a Woman borne . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Alarums . *stop*
Enter Macduffe . *stop*
Macd . *stop*
That way the noise is : Tyrant shew thy face , If thou beest slaine , and with no stroake of mine , My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still : I can not strike at wretched Kernes , whose armes Are hyr 'd to beare their Staues ; either thou Macbeth , Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge I sheath againe vndeeded . *stop*
There thou should'st be , By this great clatter , one of greatest note Seemes bruited . *stop*
Let me finde him Fortune , And more I begge not . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
Alarums . *stop*
Enter Malcolme and Seyward . *stop*
Sey . *stop*
This way my Lord , the Castles gently rendred : The Tyrants people , on both sides do fight , The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre , The day almost it selfe professes yours , And little is to do Malc . *stop*
We haue met with Foes That strike beside vs Sey . *stop*
Enter Sir , the Castle . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Alarum Enter Macbeth . *stop*
Macb . *stop*
Why should I play the Roman Foole , and dye On mine owne sword ? *stop*
whiles I see liues , the gashes Do better vpon them . *stop*
Enter Macduffe . *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Turne Hell-hound , turne Macb . *stop*
Of all men else I haue auoyded thee : But get thee backe , my soule is too much charg'd With blood of thine already Macd . *stop*
I haue no words , My voice is in my Sword , thou bloodier Villaine Then tearmes can giue thee out . *stop*
Fight : Alarum Macb . *stop*
Thou loosest labour As easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre With thy keene Sword impresse , as make me bleed : Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests , I beare a charmed Life , which must not yeeld To one of woman borne Macd . *stop*
Dispaire thy Charme , And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd Tell thee , Macduffe was from his Mothers womb Vntimely ript Macb . *stop*
Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so ; For it hath Cow 'd my better part of man : And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu 'd , That palter with vs in a double sence , That keepe the word of promise to our eare , And breake it to our hope . *stop*
Ile not fight with thee Macd . *stop*
Then yeeld thee Coward , And liue to be the shew , and gaze o'th ' time . *stop*
Wee ' l haue thee , as our rarer Monsters are Painted vpon a pole , and vnder-writ , Heere may you see the Tyrant Macb . *stop*
I will not yeeld To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet , And to be baited with the Rabbles curse . *stop*
Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou oppos 'd , being of no woman borne , Yet I will try the last . *stop*
Before my body , I throw my warlike Shield : Lay on Macduffe , And damn 'd be him , that first cries hold , enough . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

Alarums . *stop*
Enter Fighting , and Macbeth slaine . *stop*
Retreat , and Flourish . *stop*

Mal . *stop*
I would the Friends we misse , were safe arriu'd Sey . *stop*
Some must go off : and yet by these I see , So great a day as this is cheapely bought Mal . *stop*
Macduffe is missing , and your Noble Sonne Rosse . *stop*
Your son my Lord , ha 's paid a souldiers debt , He onely liu 'd but till he was a man , The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd In the vnshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he dy'de Sey . *stop*
Then he is dead ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
I , and brought off the field : your cause of sorrow Must not be measur 'd by his worth , for then It hath no end Sey . *stop*
Had he his hurts before ? *stop*
Rosse . *stop*
I , on the Front Sey . *stop*
Why then , Gods Soldier be he : Had I as many Sonnes , as I haue haires , I would not wish them to a fairer death : And so his Knell is knoll'd Mal . *stop*
Hee 's worth more sorrow , and that Ile spend for him Sey . *stop*
He 's worth no more , They say he parted well , and paid his score , And so God be with him . *stop*
Here comes newer comfort . *stop*
Enter Macduffe , with Macbeths head . *stop*
Macd . *stop*
Haile King , for so thou art . *stop*
Behold where stands Th ' Vsurpers cursed head : the time is free : I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle , That speake my salutation in their minds : Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine . *stop*
Haile King of Scotland All . *stop*
Haile King of Scotland . *stop*
Flourish . *stop*

We shall not spend a large expence of time , Before we reckon with your seuerall loues , And make vs euen with you . *stop*
My Thanes and Kinsmen Henceforth be Earles , the first that euer Scotland In such an Honor nam 'd : What 's more to do , Which would be planted newly with the time , As calling home our exil 'd Friends abroad , That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny , Producing forth the cruell Ministers Of this dead Butcher , and his Fiend-like Queene ; Who ( as 't is thought ) by selfe and violent hands , Tooke off her life . *stop*
This , and what need full else That call 's vpon vs , by the Grace of Grace , We will performe in measure , time , and place : So thankes to all at once , and to each one , Whom we inuite , to see vs Crown 'd at Scone . *stop*
Flourish . *stop*
Exeunt Omnes . *stop*
