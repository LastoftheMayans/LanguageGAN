The Tragedie of Othello , the Moore of Venice By William Shakespeare Actus Primus . *stop*
Scoena Prima . *stop*
Enter Rodorigo , and Iago . *stop*
Rodorigo . *stop*
Neuer tell me , I take it much vnkindly That thou ( Iago ) who hast had my purse , As if y strings were thine , should'st know of this Ia . *stop*
But you ' l not heare me . *stop*
If euer I did dream Of such a matter , abhorre me Rodo . *stop*
Thou told'st me , Thou did'st hold him in thy hate Iago . *stop*
Despise me If I do not . *stop*
Three Great-ones of the Cittie , ( In personall suite to make me his Lieutenant ) Off-capt to him : and by the faith of man I know my price , I am worth no worsse a place . *stop*
But he ( as louing his owne pride , and purposes ) Euades them , with a bumbast Circumstance , Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre , Non-suites my Mediators . *stop*
For certes , saies he , I haue already chose my Officer . *stop*
And what was he ? *stop*
For-sooth , a great Arithmatician , One Michaell Cassio , a Florentine , ( A Fellow almost damn 'd in a faire Wife ) That neuer set a Squadron in the Field , Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes More then a Spinster . *stop*
Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke : Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose As Masterly as he . *stop*
Meere pratle ( without practise ) Is all his Souldiership . *stop*
But he ( Sir ) had th ' election ; And I ( of whom his eies had seene the proofe At Rhodes , at Ciprus , and on others grounds Christen 'd , and Heathen ) must be be-leed , and calm'd By Debitor , and Creditor . *stop*
This Counter-caster , He ( in good time ) must his Lieutenant be , And I ( blesse the marke ) his Mooreships Auntient Rod . *stop*
By heauen , I rather would haue bin his hangman Iago . *stop*
Why , there 's no remedie . *stop*
'T is the cursse of Seruice ; Preferment goes by Letter , and affection , And not by old gradation , where each second Stood Heire to'th ' first . *stop*
Now Sir , be iudge your selfe , Whether I in any iust terme am Affin'd To loue the Moore ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
I would not follow him then Iago . *stop*
O Sir content you . *stop*
I follow him , to serue my turne vpon him . *stop*
We can not all be Masters , nor all Masters Can not be truely follow 'd . *stop*
You shall marke Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue ; That ( doting on his owne obsequious bondage ) Weares out his time , much like his Masters Asse , For naught but Prouender , & when he 's old Casheer 'd . *stop*
Whip me such honest knaues . *stop*
Others there are Who trym 'd in Formes , and visages of Dutie , Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues , And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords Doe well thriue by them . *stop*
And when they haue lin 'd their Coates Doe themselues Homage . *stop*
These Fellowes haue some soule , And such a one do I professe my selfe . *stop*
For ( Sir ) It is as sure as you are Rodorigo , Were I the Moore , I would not be Iago : In following him , I follow but my selfe . *stop*
Heauen is my Iudge , not I for loue and dutie , But seeming so , for my peculiar end : For when my outward Action doth demonstrate The natiue act , and figure of my heart In Complement externe , 't is not long after But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue For Dawes to pecke at ; I am not what I am Rod . *stop*
What a fall Fortune do 's the Thicks-lips owe If he can carry't thus ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Call vp her Father : Rowse him , make after him , poyson his delight , Proclaime him in the Streets . *stop*
Incense her kinsmen , And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell , Plague him with Flies : though that his Ioy be Ioy , Yet throw such chances of vexation o n't , As it may loose some colour Rodo . *stop*
Heere is her Fathers house , Ile call aloud Iago . *stop*
Doe , with like timerous accent , and dire yell , As when ( by Night and Negligence ) the Fire Is spied in populus Citties Rodo . *stop*
What hoa : Brabantio , Signior Brabantio , hoa Iago . *stop*
Awake : what hoa , Brabantio : Theeues , Theeues . *stop*
Looke to your house , your daughter , and your Bags , Theeues , Theeues Bra . *stop*
Aboue . *stop*
What is the reason of this terrible Summons ? *stop*
What is the matter there ? *stop*
Rodo . *stop*
Signior is all your Familie within ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Are your Doores lock 'd ? *stop*
Bra . *stop*
Why ? *stop*
Wherefore ask you this ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Sir , y'are rob 'd , for shame put on your Gowne , Your heart is burst , you haue lost halfe your soule Euen now , now , very now , an old blacke Ram Is tupping your white Ewe . *stop*
Arise , arise , Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell , Or else the deuill will make a Grand-sire of you . *stop*
Arise I say Bra . *stop*
What , haue you lost your wits ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
Most reuerend Signior , do you know my voice ? *stop*
Bra . *stop*
Not I : what are you ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
My name is Rodorigo Bra . *stop*
The worsser welcome : I haue charg 'd thee not to haunt about my doores : In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say , My Daughter is not for thee . *stop*
And now in madnesse ( Being full of Supper , and distempring draughtes ) Vpon malitious knauerie , dost thou come To start my quiet Rod . *stop*
Sir , Sir , Sir Bra . *stop*
But thou must needs be sure , My spirits and my place haue in their power To make this bitter to thee Rodo . *stop*
Patience good Sir Bra . *stop*
What tell'st thou me of Robbing ? *stop*
This is Venice : my house is not a Grange Rodo . *stop*
Most graue Brabantio , In simple and pure soule , I come to you Ia . *stop*
Sir : you are one of those that will not serue God , if the deuill bid you . *stop*
Because we come to do you seruice , and you thinke we are Ruffians , you'le haue your Daughter couer 'd with a Barbary horse , you'le haue your Nephewes neigh to you , you'le haue Coursers for Cozens : and Gennets for Germaines Bra . *stop*
What prophane wretch art thou ? *stop*
Ia . *stop*
I am one Sir , that comes to tell you , your Daughter and the Moore , are making the Beast with two backs Bra . *stop*
Thou art a Villaine Iago . *stop*
You are a Senator Bra . *stop*
This thou shalt answere . *stop*
I know thee Rodorigo Rod . *stop*
Sir , I will answere any thing . *stop*
But I beseech you If't be your pleasure , and most wise consent , ( As partly I find it is ) that your faire Daughter , At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th ' night Transported with no worse nor better guard , But with a knaue of common hire , a Gundelier , To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore : If this be knowne to you , and your Allowance , We then haue done you bold , and saucie wrongs . *stop*
But if you know not this , my Manners tell me , We haue your wrong rebuke . *stop*
Do not beleeue That from the sence of all Ciuilitie , I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence . *stop*
Your Daughter ( if you haue not giuen her leaue ) I say againe , hath made a grosse reuolt , Tying her Dutie , Beautie , Wit , and Fortunes In an extrauagant , and wheeling Stranger , Of here , and euery where : straight satisfie your selfe . *stop*
If she be in her Chamber , or your house , Let loose on me the Iustice of the State For thus deluding you Bra . *stop*
Strike on the Tinder , hoa : Giue me a Taper : call vp all my people , This Accident is not vnlike my dreame , Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie . *stop*
Light , I say , light . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Iag . *stop*
Farewell : for I must leaue you . *stop*
It seemes not meete , nor wholesome to my place To be producted , ( as if I stay , I shall , ) Against the Moore . *stop*
For I do know the State , ( How euer this may gall him with some checke ) Can not with safetie cast-him . *stop*
For he 's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres , ( Which euen now stands in Act ) that for their soules Another of his Fadome , they haue none , To lead their Businesse . *stop*
In which regard , Though I do hate him as I do hell paines , Yet , for necessitie of present life , I must show out a Flag , and signe of Loue , ( Which is indeed but signe ) that you shal surely find him Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search : And there will I be with him . *stop*
So farewell . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Enter Brabantio , with Seruants and Torches . *stop*
Bra . *stop*
It is too true an euill . *stop*
Gone she is , And what 's to come of my despised time , Is naught but bitternesse . *stop*
Now Rodorigo , Where didst thou see her ? *stop*
( Oh vnhappie Girle ) With the Moore saist thou ? *stop*
( Who would be a Father ? ) *stop*
How didst thou know 't was she ? *stop*
( Oh she deceaues me Past thought : ) what said she to you ? *stop*
Get moe Tapers . *stop*
Raise all my Kindred . *stop*
Are they married thinke you ? *stop*
Rodo . *stop*
Truely I thinke they are Bra . *stop*
Oh Heauen : how got she out ? *stop*
Oh treason of the blood . *stop*
Fathers , from hence trust not your Daughters minds By what you see them act . *stop*
Is there not Charmes , By which the propertie of Youth , and Maidhood May be abus 'd ? *stop*
Haue you not read Rodorigo , Of some such thing ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
Yes Sir : I haue indeed Bra . *stop*
Call vp my Brother : oh would you had had her . *stop*
Some one way , some another . *stop*
Doe you know Where we may apprehend her , and the Moore ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
I thinke I can discouer him , if you please To get good Guard , and go along with me Bra . *stop*
Pray you lead on . *stop*
At euery house Ile call , ( I may command at most ) get Weapons ( hoa ) And raise some speciall Officers of might : On good Rodorigo , I will deserue your paines . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Secunda . *stop*
Enter Othello , Iago , Attendants , with Torches . *stop*
Ia . *stop*
Though in the trade of Warre I haue slaine men , Yet do I hold it very stuffe o'th ' conscience To do no contriu 'd Murder : I lacke Iniquitie Sometime to do me seruice . *stop*
Nine , or ten times I had thought t'haue yerk 'd him here vnder the Ribbes Othello . *stop*
'T is better as it is Iago . *stop*
Nay but he prated , And spoke such scuruy , and prouoking termes Against your Honor , that with the little godlinesse I haue I did full hard forbeare him . *stop*
But I pray you Sir , Are you fast married ? *stop*
Be assur 'd of this , That the Magnifico is much belou 'd , And hath in his effect a voice potentiall As double as the Dukes : He will diuorce you . *stop*
Or put vpon you , what restraint or greeuance , The Law ( with all his might , to enforce it on ) Will giue him Cable Othel . *stop*
Let him do his spight ; My Seruices , which I haue done the Signorie Shall out-tongue his Complaints . *stop*
'T is yet to know , Which when I know , that boasting is an Honour , I shall promulgate . *stop*
I fetch my life and being , From Men of Royall Seige . *stop*
And my demerites May speake ( vnbonnetted ) to as proud a Fortune As this that I haue reach 'd . *stop*
For know Iago , But that I loue the gentle Desdemona , I would not my vnhoused free condition Put into Circumscription , and Confine , For the Seas worth . *stop*
But looke , what Lights come yond ? *stop*
Enter Cassio , with Torches . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Those are the raised Father , and his Friends : You were best go in Othel . *stop*
Not I : I must be found . *stop*
My Parts , my Title , and my perfect Soule Shall manifest me rightly . *stop*
Is it they ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
By Ianus , I thinke no Othel . *stop*
The Seruants of the Dukes ? *stop*
And my Lieutenant ? *stop*
The goodnesse of the Night vpon you ( Friends ) What is the Newes ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
The Duke do 's greet you ( Generall ) And he requires your haste , Post-haste appearance , Euen on the instant Othello . *stop*
What is the matter , thinke you ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Something from Cyprus , as I may diuine : It is a businesse of some heate . *stop*
The Gallies Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers This very night , at one anothers heeles : And many of the Consuls , rais 'd and met , Are at the Dukes already . *stop*
You haue bin hotly call 'd for , When being not at your Lodging to be found , The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests , To search you out Othel . *stop*
'T is well I am found by you : I will but spend a word here in the house , And goe with you Cassio . *stop*
Aunciant , what makes he heere ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Faith , he to night hath boarded a Land Carract , If it proue lawfull prize , he 's made for euer Cassio . *stop*
I do not vnderstand Iago . *stop*
He 's married Cassio . *stop*
To who ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Marry to- Come Captaine , will you go ? *stop*
Othel . *stop*
Haue with you Cassio . *stop*
Here comes another Troope to seeke for you . *stop*
Enter Brabantio , Rodorigo , with Officers , and Torches . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
It is Brabantio : Generall be aduis 'd , He comes to bad intent Othello . *stop*
Holla , stand there Rodo . *stop*
Signior , it is the Moore Bra . *stop*
Downe with him , Theefe Iago . *stop*
You , Rodorigo ? *stop*
Come Sir , I am for you Othe . *stop*
Keepe vp your bright Swords , for the dew will rust them . *stop*
Good Signior , you shall more command with yeares , then with your Weapons Bra . *stop*
Oh thou foule Theefe , Where hast thou stow 'd my Daughter ? *stop*
Damn 'd as thou art , thou hast enchaunted her For Ile referre me to all things of sense , ( If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound ) Whether a Maid , so tender , Faire , and Happie , So opposite to Marriage , that she shun'd The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation , Would euer haue ( t ' encurre a generall mocke ) Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome , Of such a thing as thou : to feare , not to delight ? *stop*
Iudge me the world , if 't is not grosse in sense , That thou hast practis 'd on her with foule Charmes , Abus 'd her delicate Youth , with Drugs or Minerals , That weakens Motion . *stop*
Ile haue't disputed on , 'Tis probable , and palpable to thinking ; I therefore apprehend and do attach thee , For an abuser of the World , a practiser Of Arts inhibited , and out of warrant ; Lay hold vpon him , if he do resist Subdue him , at his perill Othe . *stop*
Hold your hands Both you of my inclining , and the rest . *stop*
Were it my Cue to fight , I should haue knowne it Without a Prompter . *stop*
Whether will you that I goe To answere this your charge ? *stop*
Bra . *stop*
To Prison , till fit time Of Law , and course of direct Session Call thee to answer Othe . *stop*
What if I do obey ? *stop*
How may the Duke be therewith satisfi 'd , Whose Messengers are heere about my side , Vpon some present businesse of the State , To bring me to him Officer . *stop*
'T is true most worthy Signior , The Dukes in Counsell , and your Noble selfe , I am sure is sent for Bra . *stop*
How ? *stop*
The Duke in Counsell ? *stop*
In this time of the night ? *stop*
Bring him away ; Mine 's not an idle Cause . *stop*
The Duke himselfe , Or any of my Brothers of the State , Can not but feele this wrong , as 'twere their owne : For if such Actions may haue passage free , Bond-slaues , and Pagans shall our Statesmen be . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scaena Tertia . *stop*
Enter Duke , Senators , and Officers . *stop*
Duke . *stop*
There 's no composition in this Newes , That giues them Credite 1.Sen . *stop*
Indeed , they are disproportioned ; My Letters say , a Hundred and seuen Gallies Duke . *stop*
And mine a Hundred fortie 2.Sena . *stop*
And mine two Hundred : But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt , ( As in these Cases where the ayme reports , 'Tis oft with difference ) yet do they all confirme A Turkish Fleete , and bearing vp to Cyprus Duke . *stop*
Nay , it is possible enough to iudgement : I do not so secure me in the Error , But the maine Article I do approue In fearefull sense Saylor within . *stop*
What hoa , what hoa , what hoa . *stop*
Enter Saylor . *stop*
Officer . *stop*
A Messenger from the Gallies Duke . *stop*
Now ? *stop*
What 's the businesse ? *stop*
Sailor . *stop*
The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes , So was I bid report here to the State , By Signior Angelo Duke . *stop*
How say you by this change ? *stop*
1.Sen . *stop*
This can not be By no assay of reason . *stop*
'T is a Pageant To keepe vs in false gaze , when we consider Th ' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke ; And let our selues againe but vnderstand , That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes , So may he with more facile question beare it , For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace , But altogether lackes th ' abilities That Rhodes is dress 'd in . *stop*
If we make thought of this , We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull , To leaue that latest , which concernes him first , Neglecting an attempt of ease , and gaine To wake , and wage a danger profitlesse Duke . *stop*
Nay , in all confidence he 's not for Rhodes Officer . *stop*
Here is more Newes . *stop*
Enter a Messenger . *stop*
Messen . *stop*
The Ottamites , Reueren 'd , and Gracious , Steering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes , Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete 1.Sen . *stop*
I , so I thought : how many , as you guesse ? *stop*
Mess . *stop*
Of thirtie Saile : and now they do re-stem Their backward course , bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus . *stop*
Signior Montano , Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour , With his free dutie , recommends you thus , And prayes you to beleeue him Duke . *stop*
'T is certaine then for Cyprus : Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne ? *stop*
1.Sen . *stop*
He 's now in Florence Duke . *stop*
Write from vs , To him , Post , Post-haste , dispatch 1.Sen . *stop*
Here comes Brabantio , and the Valiant Moore . *stop*
Enter Brabantio , Othello , Cassio , Iago , Rodorigo , and Officers . *stop*
Duke . *stop*
Valiant Othello , we must straight employ you , Against the generall Enemy Ottoman . *stop*
I did not see you : welcome gentle Signior , We lack't your Counsaile , and your helpe to night Bra . *stop*
So did I yours : Good your Grace pardon me . *stop*
Neither my place , nor ought I heard of businesse Hath rais 'd me from my bed ; nor doth the generall care Take hold on me . *stop*
For my perticular griefe Is of so flood-gate , and ore-bearing Nature , That it engluts , and swallowes other sorrowes , And it is still it selfe Duke . *stop*
Why ? *stop*
What 's the matter ? *stop*
Bra . *stop*
My Daughter : oh my Daughter ! *stop*
Sen. Dead ? *stop*
Bra . *stop*
I , to me . *stop*
She is abus 'd , stolne from me , and corrupted By Spels , and Medicines , bought of Mountebanks ; For Nature , so prepostrously to erre , ( Being not deficient , blind , or lame of sense , ) Sans witch-craft could not Duke . *stop*
Who ere he be , that in this foule proceeding Hath thus beguil 'd your Daughter of her selfe , And you of her ; the bloodie Booke of Law , You shall your selfe read , in the bitter letter , After your owne sense : yea , though our proper Son Stood in your Action Bra . *stop*
Humbly I thanke your Grace , Here is the man ; this Moore , whom now it seemes Your speciall Mandate , for the State affaires Hath hither brought All . *stop*
We are verie sorry for't Duke . *stop*
What in your owne part , can you say to this ? *stop*
Bra . *stop*
Nothing , but this is so Othe . *stop*
Most Potent , Graue , and Reueren 'd Signiors , My very Noble , and approu 'd good Masters ; That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter , It is most true : true I haue married her ; The verie head , and front of my offending , Hath this extent ; no more . *stop*
Rude am I , in my speech , And little bless 'd with the soft phrase of Peace ; For since these Armes of mine , had seuen yeares pith , Till now , some nine Moones wasted , they haue vs'd Their deerest action , in the Tented Field : And little of this great world can I speake , More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles , and Battaile , And therefore little shall I grace my cause , In speaking for my selfe . *stop*
Yet , ( by your gratious patience ) I will a round vn-varnish 'd Tale deliuer , Of my whole course of Loue . *stop*
What Drugges , what Charmes , What Coniuration , and what mighty Magicke , ( For such proceeding I am charg 'd withall ) I won his Daughter Bra . *stop*
A Maiden , neuer bold : Of Spirit so still , and quiet , that her Motion Blush 'd at her selfe , and she , in spight of Nature , Of Yeares , of Country , Credite , euery thing To fall in Loue , with what she fear 'd to looke on ; It is a iudgement main 'd , and most imperfect . *stop*
That will confesse Perfection so could erre Against all rules of Nature , and must be driuen To find out practises of cunning hell Why this should be . *stop*
I therefore vouch againe , That with some Mixtures , powrefull o 're the blood , Or with some Dram , ( coniur 'd to this effect ) He wrought vpon her . *stop*
To vouch this , is no proofe , Without more wider , and more ouer Test Then these thin habits , and poore likely-hoods Of moderne seeming , do prefer against him Sen . *stop*
But Othello , speake , Did you , by indirect , and forced courses Subdue , and poyson this yong Maides affections ? *stop*
Or came it by request , and such faire question As soule , to soule affordeth ? *stop*
Othel . *stop*
I do beseech you , Send for the Lady to the Sagitary , And let her speake of me before her Father ; If you do finde me foule , in her report , The Trust , the Office , I do hold of you , Not onely take away , but let your Sentence Euen fall vpon my life Duke . *stop*
Fetch Desdemona hither Othe . *stop*
Aunciant , conduct them : You best know the place . *stop*
And tell she come , as truely as to heauen , I do confesse the vices of my blood , So iustly to your Graue eares , Ile present How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue , And she in mine Duke . *stop*
Say it Othello Othe . *stop*
Her Father lou 'd me , oft inuited me : Still question 'd me the Storie of my life , From yeare to yeare : the Battaile , Sieges , Fortune , That I haue past . *stop*
I ran it through , euen from my boyish daies , Toth ' very moment that he bad me tell it . *stop*
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances : Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field , Of haire-breadth scapes i'th ' imminent deadly breach ; Of being taken by the Insolent Foe , And sold to slauery . *stop*
Of my redemption thence , And portance in my Trauellours historie . *stop*
Wherein of Antars vast , and Desarts idle , Rough Quarries , Rocks , Hills , whose head touch heauen , It was my hint to speake . *stop*
Such was my Processe , And of the Canibals that each others eate , The Antropophague , and men whose heads Grew beneath their shoulders . *stop*
These things to heare , Would Desdemona seriously incline : But still the house Affaires would draw her hence : Which euer as she could with haste dispatch , She ' l 'd come againe , and with a greedie eare Deuoure vp my discourse . *stop*
Which I obseruing , Tooke once a pliant houre , and found good meanes To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart , That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate , Whereof by parcels she had something heard , But not instinctiuely : I did consent , And often did beguile her of her teares , When I did speake of some distressefull stroke That my youth suffer 'd : My Storie being done , She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses : She swore in faith 't was strange : 't was passing strange , 'Twas pittifull : 't was wondrous pittifull . *stop*
She wish 'd she had not heard it , yet she wish'd That Heauen had made her such a man . *stop*
She thank 'd me , And bad me , if I had a Friend that lou 'd her , I should but teach him how to tell my Story , And that would wooe her . *stop*
Vpon this hint I spake , She lou 'd me for the dangers I had past , And I lou 'd her , that she did pitty them . *stop*
This onely is the witch-craft I haue vs 'd . *stop*
Here comes the Ladie : Let her witnesse it . *stop*
Enter Desdemona , Iago , Attendants . *stop*
Duke . *stop*
I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too , Good Brabantio , take vp this mangled matter at the best : Men do their broken Weapons rather vse , Then their bare hands Bra . *stop*
I pray you heare her speake ? *stop*
If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer , Destruction on my head , if my bad blame Light on the man . *stop*
Come hither gentle Mistris , Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie , Where most you owe obedience ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
My Noble Father , I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie . *stop*
To you I am bound for life , and education : My life and education both do learne me , How to respect you . *stop*
You are the Lord of duty , I am hitherto your Daughter . *stop*
But heere 's my Husband ; And so much dutie , as my Mother shew'd To you , preferring you before her Father : So much I challenge , that I may professe Due to the Moore my Lord Bra . *stop*
God be with you : I haue done . *stop*
Please it your Grace , on to the State Affaires ; I had rather to adopt a Child , then get it . *stop*
Come hither Moore ; I here do giue thee that with all my heart , Which but thou hast already , with all my heart I would keepe from thee . *stop*
For your sake ( Iewell ) I am glad at soule , I haue no other Child , For thy escape would teach me Tirranie To hang clogges on them . *stop*
I haue done my Lord Duke . *stop*
Let me speake like your selfe : And lay a Sentence , Which as a grise , or step may helpe these Louers . *stop*
When remedies are past , the griefes are ended By seeing the worst , which late on hopes depended . *stop*
To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon , Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on . *stop*
What can not be preseru 'd , when Fortune takes : Patience , her Iniury a mock'ry makes . *stop*
The rob 'd that smiles , steales something from the Thiefe , He robs himselfe , that spends a bootelesse griefe Bra . *stop*
So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile , We loose it not so long as we can smile : He beares the Sentence well , that nothing beares , But the free comfort which from thence he heares . *stop*
But he beares both the Sentence , and the sorrow , That to pay griefe , must of poore Patience borrow . *stop*
These Sentences , to Sugar , or to Gall , Being strong on both sides , are Equiuocall . *stop*
But words are words , I neuer yet did heare : That the bruized heart was pierc 'd through the eares . *stop*
I humbly beseech you proceed to th ' Affaires of State Duke . *stop*
The Turke with a most mighty Preparation makes for Cyprus : Othello , the Fortitude of the place is best knowne to you . *stop*
And though we haue there a Substitute of most allowed sufficiencie ; yet opinion , a more soueraigne Mistris of Effects , throwes a more safer voice on you : you must therefore be content to slubber the glosse of your new Fortunes , with this more stubborne , and boystrous expedition Othe . *stop*
The Tirant Custome , most Graue Senators , Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre My thrice-driuen bed of Downe . *stop*
I do agnize A Naturall and prompt Alacratie , I finde in hardnesse : and do vndertake This present Warres against the Ottamites . *stop*
Most humbly therefore bending to your State , I craue fit disposition for my Wife , Due reference of Place , and Exhibition , With such Accomodation and besort As leuels with her breeding Duke . *stop*
Why at her Fathers ? *stop*
Bra . *stop*
I will not haue it so Othe . *stop*
Nor I Des . *stop*
Nor would I there recide , To put my Father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye . *stop*
Most Gracious Duke , To my vnfolding , lend your prosperous eare , And let me finde a Charter in your voice T ' assist my simplenesse Duke . *stop*
What would you Desdemona ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
That I loue the Moore , to liue with him , My downe-right violence , and storme of Fortunes , May trumpet to the world . *stop*
My heart 's subdu'd Euen to the very quality of my Lord ; I saw Othello 's visage in his mind , And to his Honours and his valiant parts , Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate . *stop*
So that ( deere Lords ) if I be left behind A Moth of Peace , and he go to the Warre , The Rites for why I loue him , are bereft me : And I a heauie interim shall support By his deere absence . *stop*
Let me go with him Othe . *stop*
Let her haue your voice . *stop*
Vouch with me Heauen , I therefore beg it not To please the pallate of my Appetite : Nor to comply with heat the yong affects In my defunct , and proper satisfaction . *stop*
But to be free , and bounteous to her minde : And Heauen defend your good soules , that you thinke I will your serious and great businesse scant When she is with me . *stop*
No , when light wing 'd Toyes Of feather 'd Cupid , seele with wanton dulnesse My speculatiue , and offic 'd Instrument : That my Disports corrupt , and taint my businesse : Let House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme , And all indigne , and base aduersities , Make head against my Estimation Duke . *stop*
Be it as you shall priuately determine , Either for her stay , or going : th ' Affaire cries hast : And speed must answer it Sen. You must away to night Othe . *stop*
With all my heart Duke . *stop*
At nine i'th ' morning , here wee ' l meete againe . *stop*
Othello , leaue some Officer behind And he shall our Commission bring to you : And such things else of qualitie and respect As doth import you Othe . *stop*
So please your Grace , my Ancient , A man he is of honesty and trust : To his conueyance I assigne my wife , With what else needfull , your good Grace shall think To be sent after me Duke . *stop*
Let it be so : Good night to euery one . *stop*
And Noble Signior , If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke , Your Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke Sen . *stop*
Adieu braue Moore , vse Desdemona well Bra . *stop*
Looke to her ( Moore ) if thou hast eies to see : She ha 's deceiu 'd her Father , and may thee . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Othe . *stop*
My life vpon her faith . *stop*
Honest Iago , My Desdemona must I leaue to thee : I prythee let thy wife attend on her , And bring them after in the best aduantage . *stop*
Come Desdemona , I haue but an houre Of Loue , of wordly matter , and direction To spend with thee . *stop*
We must obey the time . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Rod . *stop*
Iago Iago . *stop*
What saist thou Noble heart ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
What will I do , think'st thou ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Why go to bed and sleepe Rod . *stop*
I will incontinently drowne my selfe Iago . *stop*
If thou do'st , I shall neuer loue thee after . *stop*
Why thou silly Gentleman ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
It is sillynesse to liue , when to liue is torment : and then haue we a prescription to dye , when death is our Physition Iago . *stop*
Oh villanous : I haue look 'd vpon the world for foure times seuen yeares , and since I could distinguish betwixt a Benefit , and an Iniurie : I neuer found man that knew how to loue himselfe . *stop*
Ere I would say , I would drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen , I would change my Humanity with a Baboone Rod . *stop*
What should I do ? *stop*
I confesse it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my vertue to amend it Iago . *stop*
Vertue ? *stop*
A figge , 't is in our selues that we are thus , or thus . *stop*
Our Bodies are our Gardens , to the which , our Wills are Gardiners . *stop*
So that if we will plant Nettels , or sowe Lettice : Set Hisope , and weede vp Time : Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes , or distract it with many : either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse , or manured with Industry , why the power , and Corrigeable authoritie of this lies in our Wills . *stop*
If the braine of our liues had not one Scale of Reason , to poize another of Sensualitie , the blood , and basenesse of our Natures would conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions . *stop*
But we haue Reason to coole our raging Motions , our carnall Stings , or vnbitted Lusts : whereof I take this , that you call Loue , to be a Sect , or Seyen Rod . *stop*
It can not be Iago . *stop*
It is meerly a Lust of the blood , and a permission of the will . *stop*
Come , be a man : drowne thy selfe ? *stop*
Drown Cats , and blind Puppies . *stop*
I haue profest me thy Friend , and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing , with Cables of perdurable toughnesse . *stop*
I could neuer better steed thee then now . *stop*
Put Money in thy purse : follow thou the Warres , defeate thy fauour , with an vsurp 'd Beard . *stop*
I say put Money in thy purse . *stop*
It can not be long that Desdemona should continue her loue to the Moore . *stop*
Put Money in thy purse : nor he his to her . *stop*
It was a violent Commencement in her , and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration , put but Money in thy purse . *stop*
These Moores are changeable in their wils : fill thy purse with Money . *stop*
The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts , shalbe to him shortly , as bitter as Coloquintida . *stop*
She must change for youth : when she is sated with his body she will find the errors of her choice . *stop*
Therefore , put Money in thy purse . *stop*
If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe , do it a more delicate way then drowning . *stop*
Make all the Money thou canst : If Sanctimonie , and a fraile vow , betwixt an erring Barbarian , and super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits , and all the Tribe of hell , thou shalt enioy her : therefore make Money : a pox of drowning thy selfe , it is cleane out of the way . *stop*
Seeke thou rather to be hang 'd in Compassing thy ioy , then to be drown 'd , and go without her Rodo . *stop*
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes , if I depend on the issue ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Thou art sure of me : Go make Money : I haue told thee often , and I re-tell thee againe , and againe , I hate the Moore . *stop*
My cause is hearted ; thine hath no lesse reason . *stop*
Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge , against him . *stop*
If thou canst Cuckold him , thou dost thy selfe a pleasure , me a sport . *stop*
There are many Euents in the Wombe of Time , which wilbe deliuered . *stop*
Trauerse , go , prouide thy Money . *stop*
We will haue more of this to morrow . *stop*
Adieu Rod . *stop*
Where shall we meete i'th ' morning ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
At my Lodging Rod . *stop*
Ile be with thee betimes Iago . *stop*
Go too , farewell . *stop*
Do you heare Rodorigo ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
Ile sell all my Land . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Thus do I euer make my Foole , my purse : For I mine owne gain 'd knowledge should prophane If I would time expend with such Snipe , But for my Sport , and Profit : I hate the Moore , And it is thought abroad , that 'twixt my sheets She ha 's done my Office . *stop*
I know not if't be true , But I , for meere suspition in that kinde , Will do , as if for Surety . *stop*
He holds me well , The better shall my purpose worke on him : Cassio 's a proper man : Let me see now , To get his Place , and to plume vp my will In double Knauery . *stop*
How ? *stop*
How ? *stop*
Let 's see . *stop*
After some time , to abuse Othello 's eares , That he is too familiar with his wife : He hath a person , and a smooth dispose To be suspected : fram 'd to make women false . *stop*
The Moore is of a free , and open Nature , That thinkes men honest , that but seeme to be so , And will as tenderly be lead by'th ' Nose As Asses are : I hau't : it is engendred : Hell , and Night , Must bring this monstrous Birth , to the worlds light . *stop*
Actus Secundus . *stop*
Scena Prima . *stop*
Enter Montano , and two Gentlemen . *stop*
Mon . *stop*
What from the Cape , can you discerne at Sea ? *stop*
1.Gent . *stop*
Nothing at all , it is a high wrought Flood : I can not 'twixt the Heauen , and the Maine , Descry a Saile Mon . *stop*
Me thinks , the wind hath spoke aloud at Land , A fuller blast ne 're shooke our Battlements : If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea , What ribbes of Oake , when Mountaines melt on them , Can hold the Morties . *stop*
What shall we heare of this ? *stop*
2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet : For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore , The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds , The winde-shak'd-Surge , with high & monstrous Maine Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare , And quench the Guards of th ' euer-fixed Pole : I neuer did like mollestation view On the enchafed Flood Men . *stop*
If that the Turkish Fleete Be not enshelter 'd , and embay 'd , they are drown 'd , It is impossible to beare it out . *stop*
Enter a Gentleman . *stop*
3 Newes Laddes : our warres are done : The desperate Tempest hath so bang 'd the Turkes , That their designement halts . *stop*
A Noble ship of Venice , Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance On most part of their Fleet Mon . *stop*
How ? *stop*
Is this true ? *stop*
3 The Ship is heere put in : A Verennessa , Michael Cassio Lieutenant to the warlike Moore , Othello , Is come on Shore : the Moore himselfe at Sea , And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus Mon . *stop*
I am glad o n't : 'Tis a worthy Gouernour 3 But this same Cassio , though he speake of comfort , Touching the Turkish losse , yet he lookes sadly , And praye the Moore be safe ; for they were parted With fowle and violent Tempest Mon . *stop*
Pray Heauens he be : For I haue seru 'd him , and the man commands Like a full Soldier . *stop*
Let 's to the Sea-side ( hoa ) As well to see the Vessell that 's come in , As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello , Euen till we make the Maine , and th ' Eriall blew , An indistinct regard Gent . *stop*
Come , let 's do so ; For euery Minute is expectancie Of more Arriuancie . *stop*
Enter Cassio . *stop*
Cassi . *stop*
Thankes you , the valiant of the warlike Isle , That so approoue the Moore : Oh let the Heauens Giue him defence against the Elements , For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea Mon . *stop*
Is he well ship 'd ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
His Barke is stoutly Timber 'd , and his Pylot Of verie expert , and approu 'd Allowance ; Therefore my hope 's ( not surfetted to death ) Stand in bold Cure Within . *stop*
A Saile , a Saile , a Saile Cassio . *stop*
What noise ? *stop*
Gent . *stop*
The Towne is empty ; on the brow o'th ' Sea Stand rankes of People and they cry , a Saile Cassio . *stop*
My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor Gent . *stop*
They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie , Our Friends , at least Cassio . *stop*
I pray you Sir , go forth , And giue vs truth who 't is that is arriu'd Gent . *stop*
I shall . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Mon . *stop*
But good Lieutenant , is your Generall wiu 'd ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Most fortunately : he hath atchieu 'd a Maid That paragons description , and wilde Fame : One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens , And in th ' essentiall Vesture of Creation , Do 's tyre the Ingeniuer . *stop*
Enter Gentleman . *stop*
How now ? *stop*
Who ha 's put in ? *stop*
Gent . *stop*
'T is one Iago , Auncient to the Generall Cassio . *stop*
Ha 's had most fauourable , and happie speed : Tempests themselues , high Seas , and howling windes , The gutter'd-Rockes , and Congregated Sands , Traitors ensteep 'd , to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele , As hauing sence of Beautie , do omit Their mortall Natures , letting go safely by The Diuine Desdemona Mon . *stop*
What is she ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
She that I spake of : Our great Captains Captaine , Left in the conduct of the bold Iago , Whose footing heere anticipates our thoughts , A Senights speed . *stop*
Great Ioue , Othello guard , And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath , That he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship , Make loues quicke pants in Desdemonaes Armes , Giue renew 'd fire to our extincted Spirits . *stop*
Enter Desdemona , Iago , Rodorigo , and Aemilia . *stop*
Oh behold , The Riches of the Ship is come on shore : You men of Cyprus , let her haue your knees . *stop*
Haile to thee Ladie : and the grace of Heauen , Before , behinde thee , and on euery hand Enwheele thee round Des . *stop*
I thanke you , Valiant Cassio , What tydings can you tell of my Lord ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
He is not yet arriu 'd , nor know I ought But that he 's well , and will be shortly heere Des . *stop*
Oh , but I feare : How lost you company ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
The great Contention of Sea , and Skies Parted our fellowship . *stop*
But hearke , a Saile Within . *stop*
A Saile , a Saile Gent . *stop*
They giue this greeting to the Cittadell : This likewise is a Friend Cassio . *stop*
See for the Newes : Good Ancient , you are welcome . *stop*
Welcome Mistris : Let it not gaule your patience ( good Iago ) That I extend my Manners . *stop*
'T is my breeding , That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie Iago . *stop*
Sir , would she giue you so much of her lippes , As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me , You would haue enough Des . *stop*
Alas : she ha 's no speech Iago . *stop*
Infaith too much : I finde it still , when I haue leaue to sleepe . *stop*
Marry before your Ladyship , I grant , She puts her tongue a little in her heart , And chides with thinking aemil . *stop*
You haue little cause to say so Iago . *stop*
Come on , come on : you are Pictures out of doore : Bells in your Parlours : Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens : Saints in your Iniuries : Diuels being offended : Players in your Huswiferie , and Huswiues in your Beds Des . *stop*
Oh , fie vpon thee , Slanderer Iago . *stop*
Nay , it is true : or else I am a Turke , You rise to play , and go to bed to worke . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
You shall not write my praise Iago . *stop*
No , let me not Desde . *stop*
What would'st write of me , if thou should'st praise me ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Oh , gentle Lady , do not put me too't , For I am nothing , if not Criticall Des . *stop*
Come on , assay . *stop*
There 's one gone to the Harbour ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I Madam Des . *stop*
I am not merry : but I do beguile The thing I am , by seeming otherwise . *stop*
Come , how would'st thou praise me ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I am about it , but indeed my inuention comes from my pate , as Birdlyme do 's from Freeze , it pluckes out Braines and all . *stop*
But my Muse labours , and thus she is deliuer 'd . *stop*
If she be faire , and wise : fairenesse , and wit , The ones for vse , the other vseth it Des . *stop*
Well prais 'd : How if she be Blacke and Witty ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
If she be blacke , and thereto haue a wit , She'le find a white , that shall her blacknesse fit Des . *stop*
Worse , and worse . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
How if Faire , and Foolish ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
She neuer yet was foolish that was faire , For euen her folly helpt her to an heire Desde . *stop*
These are old fond Paradoxes , to make Fooles laugh i'th ' Alehouse . *stop*
What miserable praise hast thou for her that 's Foule , and Foolish Iago . *stop*
There 's none so foule and foolish thereunto , But do 's foule pranks , which faire , and wise-ones do Desde . *stop*
Oh heauy ignorance : thou praisest the worst best . *stop*
But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing woman indeed ? *stop*
One , that in the authorithy of her merit , did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it selfe Iago . *stop*
She that was euer faire , and neuer proud , Had Tongue at will , and yet was neuer loud : Neuer lackt Gold , and yet went neuer gay , Fled from her wish , and yet said now I may . *stop*
She that being angred , her reuenge being nie , Bad her wrong stay , and her displeasure flie : She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile , To change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile : She that could thinke , and neu ' r disclose her mind , See Suitors following , and not looke behind : She was a wight , ( if euer such wightes were ) Des . *stop*
To do what ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
To suckle Fooles , and chronicle small Beere Desde . *stop*
Oh most lame and impotent conclusion . *stop*
Do not learne of him aemillia , though he be thy husband . *stop*
How say you ( Cassio ) is he not a most prophane , and liberall Counsailor ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
He speakes home ( Madam ) you may rellish him more in the Souldier , then in the Scholler Iago . *stop*
He takes her by the palme : I , well said , whisper . *stop*
With as little a web as this , will I ensnare as great a Fly as Cassio . *stop*
I smile vpon her , do : I will giue thee in thine owne Courtship . *stop*
You say true , 't is so indeed . *stop*
If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie , it had beene better you had not kiss 'd your three fingers so oft , which now againe you are most apt to play the Sir , in . *stop*
Very good : well kiss 'd , and excellent Curtsie : 'tis so indeed . *stop*
Yet againe , your fingers to your lippes ? *stop*
Would they were Cluster-pipes for your sake . *stop*
The Moore I know his Trumpet Cassio . *stop*
'T is truely so Des . *stop*
Let 's meete him , and recieue him Cassio . *stop*
Loe , where he comes . *stop*
Enter Othello , and Attendants . *stop*
Oth . *stop*
O , my faire Warriour Des . *stop*
My deere Othello Othe . *stop*
It giues me wonder great , as my content To see you heere before me . *stop*
Oh my Soules Ioy : If after euery Tempest , come such Calmes , May the windes blow , till they haue waken 'd death : And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas Olympus high : and duck againe as low , As hell 's from Heauen . *stop*
If it were now to dye , 'Twere now to be most happy . *stop*
For I feare , My Soule hath her content so absolute , That not another comfort like to this , Succeedes in vnknowne Fate Des . *stop*
The Heauens forbid But that our Loues And Comforts should encrease Euen as our dayes do grow Othe . *stop*
Amen to that ( sweet Powers ) I can not speake enough of this content , It stoppes me heere : it is too much of ioy . *stop*
And this , and this the greatest discords be That ere our hearts shall make Iago . *stop*
Oh you are well tun 'd now : But Ile set downe the peggs that make this Musicke , as honest as I am Othe . *stop*
Come : let vs to the Castle . *stop*
Newes ( Friends ) our Warres are done : The Turkes are drown 'd . *stop*
How do 's my old Acquaintance of this Isle ? *stop*
( Hony ) you shall be well desir 'd in Cyprus , I haue found great loue among'st them . *stop*
Oh my Sweet , I prattle out of fashion , and I doate In mine owne comforts . *stop*
I prythee , good Iago , Go to the Bay , and disimbarke my Coffers : Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell , He is a good one , and his worthynesse Do 's challenge much respect . *stop*
Come Desdemona , Once more well met at Cyprus . *stop*
Exit Othello and Desdemona . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour . *stop*
Come thither , if thou be'st Valiant , ( as they say base men being in Loue , haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures , more then is natiue to them ) list-me ; the Lieutenant to night watches on the Court of Guard . *stop*
First , I must tell thee this : Desdemona , is directly in loue with him Rod . *stop*
With him ? *stop*
Why , 't is not possible Iago . *stop*
Lay thy finger thus : and let thy soule be instructed . *stop*
Marke me with what violence she first lou'd the Moore , but for bragging , and telling her fantasticall lies . *stop*
To loue him still for prating , let not thy discreet heart thinke it . *stop*
Her eye must be fed . *stop*
And what delight shall she haue to looke on the diuell ? *stop*
When the Blood is made dull with the Act of Sport , there should be a game to enflame it , and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite . *stop*
Louelinesse in fauour , simpathy in yeares , Manners , and Beauties : all which the Moore is defectiue in . *stop*
Now for want of these requir 'd Conueniences , her delicate tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus 'd , begin to heaue the , gorge , disrellish and abhorre the Moore , very Nature wil instruct her in it , and compell her to some second choice . *stop*
Now Sir , this granted ( as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd position ) who stands so eminent in the degree of this Fortune , as Cassio do 's : a knaue very voluble : no further conscionable , then in putting on the meere forme of Ciuill , and Humaine seeming , for the better compasse of his salt , and most hidden loose Affection ? *stop*
Why none , why none : A slipper , and subtle knaue , a finder of occasion : that he 's an eye can stampe , and counterfeit Aduantages , though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe . *stop*
A diuelish knaue : besides , the knaue is handsome , young : and hath all those requisites in him , that folly and greene mindes looke after . *stop*
A pestilent compleat knaue , and the woman hath found him already Rodo . *stop*
I can not beleeue that in her , she 's full of most bless 'd condition Iago . *stop*
Bless 'd figges-end . *stop*
The Wine she drinkes is made of grapes . *stop*
If shee had beene bless 'd , shee would neuer haue lou 'd the Moore : Bless 'd pudding . *stop*
Didst thou not see her paddle with the palme of his hand ? *stop*
Didst not marke that ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
Yes , that I did : but that was but curtesie Iago . *stop*
Leacherie by this hand : an Index , and obscure prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts . *stop*
They met so neere with their lippes , that their breathes embrac 'd together . *stop*
Villanous thoughts Rodorigo , when these mutabilities so marshall the way , hard at hand comes the Master , and maine exercise , th ' incorporate conclusion : Pish . *stop*
But Sir , be you rul 'd by me . *stop*
I haue brought you from Venice . *stop*
Watch you to night : for the Command , Ile lay't vpon you . *stop*
Cassio knowes you not : Ile not be farre from you . *stop*
Do you finde some occasion to anger Cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more fauorably minister Rod . *stop*
Well Iago . *stop*
Sir , he 's rash , and very sodaine in Choller : and happely may strike at you , prouoke him that he may : for euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny . *stop*
Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe , but by the displanting of Cassio . *stop*
So shall you haue a shorter iourney to your desires , by the meanes I shall then haue to preferre them . *stop*
And the impediment most profitably remoued , without the which there were no expectation of our prosperitie Rodo . *stop*
I will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity Iago . *stop*
I warrant thee . *stop*
Meete me by and by at the Cittadell . *stop*
I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore . *stop*
Farewell Rodo . *stop*
Adieu . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
That Cassio loues her , I do well beleeu't : That she loues him , 't is apt , and of great Credite . *stop*
The Moore ( howbeit that I endure him not ) Is of a constant , louing , Noble Nature , And I dare thinke , he'le proue to Desdemona A most deere husband . *stop*
Now I do loue her too , Not out of absolute Lust , ( though peraduenture I stand accomptant for as great a sin ) But partely led to dyet my Reuenge , For that I do suspect the lustie Moore Hath leap 'd into my Seate . *stop*
The thought whereof , Doth ( like a poysonous Minerall ) gnaw my Inwardes : And nothing can , or shall content my Soule Till I am eeuen 'd with him , wife , for wife . *stop*
Or fayling so , yet that I put the Moore , At least into a Ielouzie so strong That iudgement can not cure . *stop*
Which thing to do , If this poore Trash of Venice , whom I trace For his quicke hunting , stand the putting on , Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip , Abuse him to the Moore , in the right garbe ( For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too ) Make the Moore thanke me , loue me , and reward me , For making him egregiously an Asse , And practising vpon his peace , and quiet , Euen to madnesse . *stop*
'T is heere : but yet confus 'd , Knaueries plaine face , is neuer seene , till vs 'd . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Scena Secunda . *stop*
Enter Othello 's Herald with a Proclamation . *stop*
Herald . *stop*
It is Othello 's pleasure , our Noble and Valiant Generall . *stop*
That vpon certaine tydings now arriu 'd , importing the meere perdition of the Turkish Fleete : euery man put himselfe into Triumph . *stop*
Some to daunce , some to make Bonfires , each man , to what Sport and Reuels his addition leads him . *stop*
For besides these beneficiall Newes , it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall . *stop*
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed . *stop*
All offices are open , & there is full libertie of Feasting from this present houre of fiue , till the Bell haue told eleuen . *stop*
Blesse the Isle of Cyprus , and our Noble Generall Othello . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Enter Othello , Desdemona , Cassio , and Attendants . *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Good Michael , looke you to the guard to night . *stop*
Let 's teach our selues that Honourable stop , Not to out-sport discretion Cas . *stop*
Iago , hath direction what to do . *stop*
But notwithstanding with my personall eye Will I looke to't Othe . *stop*
Iago , is most honest : Michael , goodnight . *stop*
To morrow with your earliest , Let me haue speech with you . *stop*
Come my deere Loue , The purchase made , the fruites are to ensue , That profit 's yet to come 'tweene me , and you . *stop*
Goodnight . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Enter Iago . *stop*
Cas . *stop*
Welcome Iago : we must to the Watch Iago . *stop*
Not this houre Lieutenant : 't is not yet ten o'th ' clocke . *stop*
Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the loue of his Desdemona : Who , let vs not therefore blame ; he hath not yet made wanton the night with her : and she is sport for Ioue Cas . *stop*
She 's a most exquisite Lady Iago . *stop*
And Ile warrant her , full of Game Cas . *stop*
Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature Iago . *stop*
What an eye she ha 's ? *stop*
Me thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation Cas . *stop*
An inuiting eye : And yet me thinkes right modest Iago . *stop*
And when she speakes , Is it not an Alarum to Loue ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
She is indeed perfection Iago . *stop*
Well : happinesse to their Sheetes . *stop*
Come Lieutenant , I haue a stope of Wine , and heere without are a brace of Cyprus Gallants , that would faine haue a measure to the health of blacke Othello Cas . *stop*
Not to night , good Iago , I haue very poore , and vnhappie Braines for drinking . *stop*
I could well wish Curtesie would inuent some other Custome of entertainment Iago . *stop*
Oh , they are our Friends : but one Cup , Ile drinke for you Cassio . *stop*
I haue drunke but one Cup to night , and that was craftily qualified too : and behold what inouation it makes heere . *stop*
I am infortunate in the infirmity , and dare not taske my weakenesse with any more Iago . *stop*
What man ? *stop*
'T is a night of Reuels , the Gallants desire it Cas . *stop*
Where are they ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Heere , at the doore : I pray you call them in Cas . *stop*
Ile do't , but it dislikes me . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him With that which he hath drunke to night alreadie , He ' l be as full of Quarrell , and offence As my yong Mistris dogge . *stop*
Now my sicke Foole Rodorigo , Whom Loue hath turn 'd almost the wrong side out , To Desdemona hath to night Carrows 'd . *stop*
Potations , pottle-deepe ; and he 's to watch . *stop*
Three else of Cyprus , Noble swelling Spirites , ( That hold their Honours in a wary distance , The very Elements of this Warrelike Isle ) Haue I to night fluster 'd with flowing Cups , And they Watch too . *stop*
Now 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards Am I put to our Cassio in some Action That may offend the Isle . *stop*
But here they come . *stop*
Enter Cassio , Montano , and Gentlemen . *stop*
If Consequence do but approue my dreame , My Boate sailes freely , both with winde and Streame Cas . *stop*
'Fore heauen , they haue giuen me a rowse already Mon . *stop*
Good-faith a litle one : not past a pint , as I am a Souldier Iago . *stop*
Some Wine hoa . *stop*
And let me the Cannakin clinke , clinke : And let me the Cannakin clinke . *stop*
A Souldiers a man : Oh , mans life 's but a span , Why then let a Souldier drinke . *stop*
Some Wine Boyes Cas . *stop*
'Fore Heauen : an excellent Song Iago . *stop*
I learn 'd it in England : where indeed they are most potent in Potting . *stop*
Your Dane , your Germaine , and your swag-belly 'd Hollander , ( drinke hoa ) are nothing to your English Cassio . *stop*
Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Why , he drinkes you with facillitie , your Dane dead drunke . *stop*
He sweates not to ouerthrow your Almaine . *stop*
He giues your Hollander a vomit , ere the next Pottle can be fill'd Cas . *stop*
To the health of our Generall Mon . *stop*
I am for it Lieutenant : and Ile do you Iustice Iago . *stop*
Oh sweet England . *stop*
King Stephen was anda worthy Peere , His Breeches cost him but a Crowne , He held them Six pence all to deere , With that he cal 'd the Tailor Lowne : He was a wight of high Renowne , And thou art but of low degree : 'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe , And take thy awl 'd Cloake about thee . *stop*
Some Wine hoa Cassio . *stop*
Why this is a more exquisite Song then the other Iago . *stop*
Will you heare't againe ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
No : for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place , that do 's those things . *stop*
Well : heau'ns aboue all : and there be soules must be saued , and there be soules must not be saued Iago . *stop*
It 's true , good Lieutenant Cas . *stop*
For mine owne part , no offence to the Generall , nor any man of qualitie : I hope to be saued Iago . *stop*
And so do I too Lieutenant Cassio . *stop*
I : ( but by your leaue ) not before me . *stop*
The Lieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient . *stop*
Let 's haue no more of this : let 's to our Affaires . *stop*
Forgiue vs our sinnes : Gentlemen let 's looke to our businesse . *stop*
Do not thinke Gentlemen , I am drunke : this is my Ancient , this is my right hand , and this is my left . *stop*
I am not drunke now : I can stand well enough , and I speake well enough Gent . *stop*
Excellent well Cas . *stop*
Why very well then : you must not thinke then , that I am drunke . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Monta . *stop*
To th ' Platforme ( Masters ) come , let 's set the Watch Iago . *stop*
You see this Fellow , that is gone before , He 's a Souldier , fit to stand by Caesar , And giue direction . *stop*
And do but see his vice , 'Tis to his vertue , a iust Equinox , The one as long as th ' other . *stop*
'T is pittie of him : I feare the trust Othello puts him in , On some odde time of his infirmitie Will shake this Island Mont . *stop*
But is he often thus ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
'T is euermore his prologue to his sleepe , He'le watch the Horologe a double Set , If Drinke rocke not his Cradle Mont . *stop*
It were well The Generall were put in mind of it : Perhaps he sees it not , or his good nature Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio , And lookes not on his euills : is not this true ? *stop*
Enter Rodorigo . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
How now Rodorigo ? *stop*
I pray you after the Lieutenant , go Mon . *stop*
And 't is great pitty , that the Noble Moore Should hazard such a Place , as his owne Second With one of an ingraft Infirmitie , It were an honest Action , to say so To the Moore Iago . *stop*
Not I , for this faire Island , I do loue Cassio well : and would do much To cure him of this euill , But hearke , what noise ? *stop*
Enter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo . *stop*
Cas . *stop*
You Rogue : you Rascall Mon . *stop*
What 's the matter Lieutenant ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
A Knaue teach me my dutie ? *stop*
Ile beate the Knaue in to a Twiggen-Bottle Rod . *stop*
Beate me ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
Dost thou prate , Rogue ? *stop*
Mon . *stop*
Nay , good Lieutenant : I pray you Sir , hold your hand Cassio . *stop*
Let me go ( Sir ) Or Ile knocke you o 're the Mazard Mon . *stop*
Come , come : you 're drunke Cassio . *stop*
Drunke ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Away I say : go out and cry a Mutinie . *stop*
Nay good Lieutenant . *stop*
Alas Gentlemen : Helpe hoa . *stop*
Lieutenant . *stop*
Sir Montano : Helpe Masters . *stop*
Heere 's a goodly Watch indeed . *stop*
Who 's that which rings the Bell : Diablo , hoa : The Towne will rise . *stop*
Fie , fie Lieutenant , You'le be asham 'd for euer . *stop*
Enter Othello , and Attendants . *stop*
Othe . *stop*
What is the matter heere ? *stop*
Mon . *stop*
I bleed still , I am hurt to th ' death . *stop*
He dies Othe . *stop*
Hold for your liues Iag . *stop*
Hold hoa : Lieutenant , Sir Montano , Gentlemen : Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie ? *stop*
Hold . *stop*
The Generall speaks to you : hold for shame Oth . *stop*
Why how now hoa ? *stop*
From whence ariseth this ? *stop*
Are we turn 'd Turkes ? *stop*
and to our selues do that Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes . *stop*
For Christian shame , put by this barbarous Brawle : He that stirs next , to carue for his owne rage , Holds his soule light : He dies vpon his Motion . *stop*
Silence that dreadfull Bell , it frights the Isle , From her propriety . *stop*
What is the matter , Masters ? *stop*
Honest Iago , that lookes dead with greeuing , Speake : who began this ? *stop*
On thy loue I charge thee ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I do not know : Friends all , but now , euen now . *stop*
In Quarter , and in termes like Bride , and Groome Deuesting them for Bed : and then , but now : ( As if some Planet had vnwitted men ) Swords out , and tilting one at others breastes , In opposition bloody . *stop*
I can not speake Any begining to this peeuish oddes . *stop*
And would , in Action glorious , I had lost Those legges , that brought me to a part of it Othe . *stop*
How comes it ( Michaell ) you are thus forgot ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
I pray you pardon me , I can not speake Othe . *stop*
Worthy Montano , you were wont to be ciuill : The grauitie , and stillnesse of your youth The world hath noted . *stop*
And your name is great In mouthes of wisest Censure . *stop*
What 's the matter That you vnlace your reputation thus , And spend your rich opinion , for the name Of a night-brawler ? *stop*
Giue me answer to it Mon . *stop*
Worthy Othello , I am hurt to danger , Your Officer Iago , can informe you , While I spare speech which something now offends me . *stop*
Of all that I do know , nor know I ought By me , that 's said , or done amisse this night , Vnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice , And to defend our selues , it be a sinne When violence assailes vs Othe . *stop*
Now by Heauen , My blood begins my safer Guides to rule , And passion ( hauing my best iudgement collied ) Assaies to leade the way . *stop*
If I once stir , Or do but lift this Arme , the best of you Shall sinke in my rebuke . *stop*
Giue me to know How this foule Rout began : Who set it on , And he that is approu 'd in this offence , Though he had twinn 'd with me , both at a birth , Shall loose me . *stop*
What in a Towne of warre , Yet wilde , the peoples hearts brim-full of feare , To Manage priuate , and domesticke Quarrell ? *stop*
In night , and on the Court and Guard of safetie ? *stop*
'T is monstrous : Iago , who bega n't ? *stop*
Mon . *stop*
If partially Affin 'd , or league in office , Thou dost deliuer more , or lesse then Truth , Thou art no Souldier Iago . *stop*
Touch me not so neere , I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth , Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio . *stop*
Yet I perswade my selfe , to speake the truth Shall nothing wrong him . *stop*
This it is Generall : Montano and my selfe being in speech , There comes a Fellow , crying out for helpe , And Cassio following him with determin 'd Sword To execute vpon him . *stop*
Sir , this Gentleman , Steppes in to Cassio , and entreats his pause : My selfe , the crying Fellow did pursue , Least by his clamour ( as it so fell out ) The Towne might fall in fright . *stop*
He , ( swift of foote ) Out-ran my purpose : and I return 'd then rather For that I heard the clinke , and fall of Swords , And Cassio high in oath : Which till to night I nere might say before . *stop*
When I came backe ( For this was briefe ) I found them close together At blow , and thrust , euen as againe they were When you your selfe did part them . *stop*
More of this matter can not I report , But Men are Men : The best sometimes forget , Though Cassio did some little wrong to him , As men in rage strike those that wish them best , Yet surely Cassio , I beleeue receiu'd From him that fled , some strange Indignitie , Which patience could not passe Othe . *stop*
I know Iago Thy honestie , and loue doth mince this matter , Making it light to Cassio : Cassio , I loue thee , But neuer more be Officer of mine . *stop*
Enter Desdemona attended . *stop*
Looke if my gentle Loue be not rais 'd vp : Ile make thee an example Des . *stop*
What is the matter ( Deere ? ) *stop*
Othe . *stop*
All 's well , Sweeting : Come away to bed . *stop*
Sir for your hurts , My selfe will be your Surgeon . *stop*
Lead him off : Iago , looke with care about the Towne , And silence those whom this vil 'd brawle distracted . *stop*
Come Desdemona , 't is the Soldiers life , To haue their Balmy slumbers wak 'd with strife . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
What are you hurt Lieutenant ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
I , past all Surgery Iago . *stop*
Marry Heauen forbid Cas . *stop*
Reputation , Reputation , Reputation : Oh I haue lost my Reputation . *stop*
I haue lost the immortall part of myselfe , and what remaines is bestiall . *stop*
My Reputation , Iago , my Reputation Iago . *stop*
As I am an honest man I had thought you had receiued some bodily wound ; there is more sence in that then in Reputation . *stop*
Reputation is an idle , and most false imposition ; oft got without merit , and lost without deseruing . *stop*
You haue lost no Reputation at all , vnlesse you repute your selfe such a looser . *stop*
What man , there are more wayes to recouer the Generall againe . *stop*
You are but now cast in his moode , ( a punishment more in policie , then in malice ) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse dogge , to affright an Imperious Lyon . *stop*
Sue to him againe , and he 's yours Cas . *stop*
I will rather sue to be despis 'd , then to deceiue so good a Commander , with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an Officer . *stop*
Drunke ? *stop*
And speake Parrat ? *stop*
And squabble ? *stop*
Swagger ? *stop*
Sweare ? *stop*
And discourse Fustian with ones owne shadow ? *stop*
Oh thou invisible spirit of Wine , if thou hast no name to be knowne by , let vs call thee Diuell Iago . *stop*
What was he that you follow 'd with your Sword ? *stop*
What had he done to you ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
I know not Iago . *stop*
Is't possible ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
I remember a masse of things , but nothing distinctly : a Quarrell , but nothing wherefore . *stop*
Oh , that men should put an Enemie in their mouthes , to steale away their Braines ? *stop*
that we should with ioy , pleasance , reuell and applause , transforme our selues into Beasts Iago . *stop*
Why ? *stop*
But you are now well enough : how came you thus recouered ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
It hath pleas 'd the diuell drunkennesse , to giue place to the diuell wrath , one vnperfectnesse , shewes me another to make me frankly despise my selfe Iago . *stop*
Come , you are too seuere a Moraller . *stop*
As the Time , the Place , & the Condition of this Country stands I could hartily wish this had not befalne : but since it is , as it is , mend it for your owne good Cas . *stop*
I will aske him for my Place againe , he shall tell me , I am a drunkard : had I as many mouthes as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all . *stop*
To be now a sensible man , by and by a Foole , and presently a Beast . *stop*
Oh strange ! *stop*
Euery inordinate cup is vnbless 'd , and the Ingredient is a diuell Iago . *stop*
Come , come : good wine , is a good familiar Creature , if it be well vs 'd : exclaime no more against it . *stop*
And good Lieutenant , I thinke , you thinke I loue you Cassio . *stop*
I haue well approued it , Sir . *stop*
I drunke ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
You , or any man liuing , may be drunke at a time man . *stop*
I tell you what you shall do : Our General's Wife , is now the Generall . *stop*
I may say so , in this respect , for that he hath deuoted , and giuen vp himselfe to the Contemplation , marke : and deuotement of her parts and Graces . *stop*
Confesse your selfe freely to her : Importune her helpe to put you in your place againe . *stop*
She is of so free , so kinde , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodnesse , not to do more then she is requested . *stop*
This broken ioynt betweene you , and her husband , entreat her to splinter . *stop*
And my Fortunes against any lay worth naming , this cracke of your Loue , shall grow stronger , then it was before Cassio . *stop*
You aduise me well Iago . *stop*
I protest in the sinceritie of Loue , and honest kindnesse Cassio . *stop*
I thinke it freely : and betimes in the morning , I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake for me : I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me Iago . *stop*
You are in the right : good night Lieutenant , I must to the Watch Cassio . *stop*
Good night , honest Iago . *stop*
Exit Cassio . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
And what 's he then , That saies I play the Villaine ? *stop*
When this aduise is free I giue , and honest , Proball to thinking , and indeed the course To win the Moore againe . *stop*
For 't is most easie Th ' inclyning Desdemona to subdue In any honest Suite . *stop*
She 's fram 'd as fruitefull As the free Elements . *stop*
And then for her To win the Moore , were to renownce his Baptisme , All Seales , and Simbols of redeemed sin : His Soule is so enfetter 'd to her Loue , That she may make , vnmake , do what she list , Euen as her Appetite shall play the God , With his weake Function . *stop*
How am I then a Villaine , To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course , Directly to his good ? *stop*
Diuinitie of hell , When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on , They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes , As I do now . *stop*
For whiles this honest Foole Plies Desdemona , to repaire his Fortune , And she for him , pleades strongly to the Moore , Ile powre this pestilence into his eare : That she repeales him , for her bodies Lust , And by how much she striues to do him good , She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore . *stop*
So will I turne her vertue into pitch . *stop*
And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net , That shall en-mash them all . *stop*
How now Rodorigo ? *stop*
Enter Rodorigo . *stop*
Rodorigo . *stop*
I do follow heere in the Chace , not like a Hound that hunts , but one that filles vp the Crie . *stop*
My Money is almost spent ; I haue bin to night exceedingly well Cudgell 'd : And I thinke the issue will bee , I shall haue so much experience for my paines ; And so , with no money at all , and a little more Wit , returne againe to Venice Iago . *stop*
How poore are they that haue not Patience ? *stop*
What wound did euer heale but by degrees ? *stop*
Thou know'st we worke by Wit , and not by Witchcraft And Wit depends on dilatory time : Dos't not go well ? *stop*
Cassio hath beaten thee , And thou by that small hurt hath casheer 'd Cassio : Though other things grow faire against the Sun , Yet Fruites that blossome first , will first be ripe : Content thy selfe , a-while . *stop*
Introth 't is Morning ; Pleasure , and Action , make the houres seeme short . *stop*
Retire thee , go where thou art Billited : Away , I say , thou shalt know more heereafter : Nay get thee gone . *stop*
Exit Roderigo . *stop*
Two things are to be done : My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris : Ile set her on my selfe , a while , to draw the Moor apart , And bring him iumpe , when he may Cassio finde Soliciting his wife : I , that 's the way : Dull not Deuice , by coldnesse , and delay . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Actus Tertius . *stop*
Scena Prima . *stop*
Enter Cassio , Musitians , and Clowne . *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Masters , play heere , I wil content your paines , Something that 's briefe : and bid , goodmorrow General Clo . *stop*
Why Masters , haue your Instruments bin in Naples , that they speake i'th ' Nose thus ? *stop*
Mus . *stop*
How Sir ? *stop*
how ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Are these I pray you , winde Instruments ? *stop*
Mus . *stop*
I marry are they sir Clo . *stop*
Oh , thereby hangs a tale Mus . *stop*
Whereby hangs a tale , sir ? *stop*
Clow . *stop*
Marry sir , by many a winde Instrument that I know . *stop*
But Masters , heere 's money for you : and the Generall so likes your Musick , that he desires you for loues sake to make no more noise with it Mus . *stop*
Well Sir , we will not Clo . *stop*
If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard , too't againe . *stop*
But ( as they say ) to heare Musicke , the Generall do 's not greatly care Mus . *stop*
We haue none such , sir Clow . *stop*
Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge , for Ile away . *stop*
Go , vanish into ayre , away . *stop*
Exit Mu . *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Dost thou heare me , mine honest Friend ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
No , I heare not your honest Friend : I heare you Cassio . *stop*
Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets , ther 's a poore peece of Gold for thee : if the Gentlewoman that attends the Generall be stirring , tell her , there 's one Cassio entreats her a little fauour of Speech . *stop*
Wilt thou do this ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
She is stirring sir : if she will stirre hither , I shall seeme to notifie vnto her . *stop*
Exit Clo . *stop*
Enter Iago . *stop*
In happy time , Iago Iago . *stop*
You haue not bin a-bed then ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Why no : the day had broke before we parted . *stop*
I haue made bold ( Iago ) to send in to your wife : My suite to her is , that she will to vertuous Desdemona Procure me some accesse Iago . *stop*
Ile send her to you presently : And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore Out of the way , that your conuerse and businesse May be more free . *stop*
Exit Cassio . *stop*
I humbly thanke you for't . *stop*
I neuer knew A Florentine more kinde , and honest . *stop*
Enter aemilia . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Goodmorrow ( good Lieutenant ) I am sorrie For your displeasure : but all will sure be well . *stop*
The Generall and his wife are talking of it , And she speakes for you stoutly . *stop*
The Moore replies , That he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus , And great Affinitie : and that in wholsome Wisedome He might not but refuse you . *stop*
But he protests he loues you And needs no other Suitor , but his likings To bring you in againe Cassio . *stop*
Yet I beseech you , If you thinke fit , or that it may be done , Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse With Desdemon alone . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Pray you come in : I will bestow you where you shall haue time To speake your bosome freely Cassio . *stop*
I am much bound to you . *stop*
Scoena Secunda . *stop*
Enter Othello , Iago , and Gentlemen . *stop*
Othe . *stop*
These Letters giue ( Iago ) to the Pylot , And by him do my duties to the Senate : That done , I will be walking on the Workes , Repaire there to mee Iago . *stop*
Well , my good Lord , Ile doo't Oth . *stop*
This Fortification ( Gentlemen ) shall we see't ? *stop*
Gent . *stop*
Well waite vpon your Lordship . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scoena Tertia . *stop*
Enter Desdemona , Cassio , and aemilia . *stop*
Des . *stop*
Be thou assur 'd ( good Cassio ) I will do All my abilities in thy behalfe . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Good Madam do : I warrant it greeues my Husband , As if the cause were his Des . *stop*
Oh that 's an honest Fellow , Do not doubt Cassio But I will haue my Lord , and you againe As friendly as you were Cassio . *stop*
Bounteous Madam , What euer shall become of Michael Cassio , He 's neuer any thing but your true Seruant Des . *stop*
I know't : I thanke you : you do loue my Lord : You haue knowne him long , and be you well assur'd He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off , Then in a politique distance Cassio . *stop*
I , but Lady , That policie may either last so long , Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet , Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances , That I being absent , and my place supply 'd , My Generall will forget my Loue , and Seruice Des . *stop*
Do not doubt that : before aemilia here , I giue thee warrant of thy place . *stop*
Assure thee , If I do vow a friendship , Ile performe it To the last Article . *stop*
My Lord shall neuer rest , Ile watch him tame , and talke him out of patience ; His Bed shall seeme a Schoole , his Boord a Shrift , Ile intermingle euery thing he do's With Cassio 's suite : Therefore be merry Cassio , For thy Solicitor shall rather dye , Then giue thy cause away . *stop*
Enter Othello , and Iago . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Madam , heere comes my Lord Cassio . *stop*
Madam , Ile take my leaue Des . *stop*
Why stay , and heare me speake Cassio . *stop*

Well , do your discretion . *stop*
Exit Cassio . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Hah ? *stop*
I like not that Othel . *stop*
What dost thou say ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Nothing my Lord ; or if- I know not what Othel . *stop*
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Cassio my Lord ? *stop*
No sure , I can not thinke it That he would steale away so guilty-like , Seeing your comming Oth . *stop*
I do beleeue 't was he Des . *stop*
How now my Lord ? *stop*
I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere , A man that languishes in your displeasure Oth . *stop*
Who is't you meane ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Why your Lieutenant Cassio : Good my Lord , If I haue any grace , or power to moue you , His present reconciliation take . *stop*
For if he be not one , that truly loues you , That erres in Ignorance , and not in Cunning , I haue no iudgement in an honest face . *stop*
I prythee call him backe Oth . *stop*
Went he hence now ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
I sooth ; so humbled , That he hath left part of his greefe with mee To suffer with him . *stop*
Good Loue , call him backe Othel . *stop*
Not now ( sweet Desdemon ) some other time Des . *stop*
But shall't be shortly ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
The sooner ( Sweet ) for you Des . *stop*
Shall't be to night , at Supper ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
No , not to night Des . *stop*
To morrow Dinner then ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
I shall not dine at home : I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell Des . *stop*
Why then to morrow night , on Tuesday morne , On Tuesday noone , or night ; on Wensday Morne . *stop*
I prythee name the time , but let it not Exceed three dayes . *stop*
Infaith hee 's penitent : And yet his Trespasse , in our common reason ( Saue that they say the warres must make example ) Out of her best , is not almost a fault T ' encurre a priuate checke . *stop*
When shall he come ? *stop*
Tell me Othello . *stop*
I wonder in my Soule What you would aske me , that I should deny , Or stand so mam'ring on ? *stop*
What ? *stop*
Michael Cassio , That came a woing with you ? *stop*
and so many a time ( When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly ) Hath tane your part , to haue so much to do To bring him in ? *stop*
Trust me , I could do much Oth . *stop*
Prythee no more : Let him come when he will : I will deny thee nothing Des . *stop*
Why , this is not a Boone : 'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues , Or feede on nourishing dishes , or keepe you warme , Or sue to you , to do a peculiar profit To your owne person . *stop*
Nay , when I haue a suite Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed , It shall be full of poize , and difficult waight , And fearefull to be granted Oth . *stop*
I will deny thee nothing . *stop*
Whereon , I do beseech thee , grant me this , To leaue me but a little to my selfe Des . *stop*
Shall I deny you ? *stop*
No : farewell my Lord Oth . *stop*
Farewell my Desdemona , Ile come to thee strait Des . *stop*

My Noble Lord Oth . *stop*

Did Michael Cassio When he woo 'd my Lady , know of your loue ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
He did , from first to last : Why dost thou aske ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
But for a satisfaction of my Thought , No further harme Oth . *stop*
Why of thy thought , Iago ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir Oth . *stop*
O yes , and went betweene vs very oft Iago . *stop*
Indeed ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Indeed ? *stop*
I indeed . *stop*
Discern'st thou ought in that ? *stop*
Is he not honest ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Honest , my Lord ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Honest ? *stop*
I , Honest Iago . *stop*
My Lord , for ought I know Oth . *stop*
What do'st thou thinke ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Thinke , my Lord ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Thinke , my Lord ? *stop*
Alas , thou ecchos't me ; As if there were some Monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shewne . *stop*
Thou dost mean somthing : I heard thee say euen now , thou lik'st not that , When Cassio left my wife . *stop*
What didd'st not like ? *stop*
And when I told thee , he was of my Counsaile , Of my whole course of wooing ; thou cried'st , Indeede ? *stop*
And didd'st contract , and purse thy brow together , As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine Some horrible Conceite . *stop*
If thou do'st loue me , Shew me thy thought Iago . *stop*
My Lord , you know I loue you Oth . *stop*
I thinke thou do'st : And for I know thou'rt full of Loue , and Honestie , And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath , Therefore these stops of thine , fright me the more : For such things in a false disloyall Knaue Are trickes of Custome : but in a man that 's iust , They 're close dilations , working from the heart , That Passion can not rule Iago . *stop*
For Michael Cassio , I dare be sworne , I thinke that he is honest Oth . *stop*
I thinke so too Iago . *stop*
Men should be what they seeme , Or those that be not , would they might seeme none Oth . *stop*
Certaine , men should be what they seeme Iago . *stop*
Why then I thinke Cassio 's an honest man Oth . *stop*
Nay , yet there 's more in this ? *stop*
I prythee speake to me , as to thy thinkings , As thou dost ruminate , and giue thy worst of thoughts The worst of words Iago . *stop*
Good my Lord pardon me , Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie , I am not bound to that : All Slaues are free : Vtter my Thoughts ? *stop*
Why say , they are vild , and falce ? *stop*
As where 's that Palace , whereinto foule things Sometimes intrude not ? *stop*
Who ha 's that breast so pure , Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions Keepe Leetes , and Law-dayes , and in Sessions sit With meditations lawfull ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend ( Iago ) If thou but think'st him wrong 'd , and mak'st his eare A stranger to thy Thoughts Iago . *stop*
I do beseech you , Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse ( As I confesse it is my Natures plague To spy into Abuses , and of my iealousie Shapes faults that are not ) that your wisedome From one , that so imperfectly conceits , Would take no notice , nor build your selfe a trouble Out of his scattering , and vnsure obseruance : It were not for your quiet , nor your good , Nor for my Manhood , Honesty , and Wisedome , To let you know my thoughts Oth . *stop*
What dost thou meane ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Good name in Man , & woman ( deere my Lord ) Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules ; Who steales my purse , steales trash : 'Tis something , nothing ; 'Twas mine , 't is his , and has bin slaue to thousands : But he that filches from me my good Name , Robs me of that , which not enriches him , And makes me poore indeed Oth . *stop*
Ile know thy Thoughts Iago . *stop*
You can not , if my heart were in your hand , Nor shall not , whil'st 't is in my custodie Oth . *stop*
Ha ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Oh , beware my Lord , of iealousie , It is the greene-ey 'd Monster , which doth mocke The meate it feeds on . *stop*
That Cuckold liues in blisse , Who certaine of his Fate , loues not his wronger : But oh , what damned minutes tels he ore , Who dotes , yet doubts : Suspects , yet soundly loues ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
O miserie Iago . *stop*
Poore , and Content , is rich , and rich enough , But Riches finelesse , is as poore as Winter , To him that euer feares he shall be poore : Good Heauen , the Soules of all my Tribe defend From Iealousie Oth . *stop*
Why ? *stop*
why is this ? *stop*
Think'st thou , I'ld make a Life of Iealousie ; To follow still the changes of the Moone With fresh suspitions ? *stop*
No : to be once in doubt , Is to be resolu 'd : Exchange me for a Goat , When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule To such exufflicate , and blow 'd Surmises , Matching thy inference . *stop*
'T is not to make me Iealious , To say my wife is faire , feeds well , loues company , Is free of Speech , Sings , Playes , and Dances : Where Vertue is , these are more vertuous . *stop*
Nor from mine owne weake merites , will I draw The smallest feare , or doubt of her reuolt , For she had eyes , and chose me . *stop*
No Iago , Ile see before I doubt ; when I doubt , proue ; And on the proofe , there is no more but this , Away at once with Loue , or Iealousie Ia . *stop*
I am glad of this : For now I shall haue reason To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you With franker spirit . *stop*
Therefore ( as I am bound ) Receiue it from me . *stop*
I speake not yet of proofe : Looke to your wife , obserue her well with Cassio , Weare your eyes , thus : not Iealious , nor Secure : I would not haue your free , and Noble Nature , Out of selfe-Bounty , be abus 'd : Looke too't : I know our Country disposition well : In Venice , they do let Heauen see the prankes They dare not shew their Husbands . *stop*
Their best Conscience , Is not to leaue't vndone , but kept vnknowne Oth . *stop*
Dost thou say so ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
She did deceiue her Father , marrying you , And when she seem 'd to shake , and feare your lookes , She lou 'd them most Oth . *stop*
And so she did Iago . *stop*
Why go too then : Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming To seele her Fathers eyes vp , close as Oake , He thought 't was Witchcraft . *stop*
But I am much too blame : I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much louing you Oth . *stop*
I am bound to thee for euer Iago . *stop*
I see this hath a little dash 'd your Spirits : Oth . *stop*
Not a iot , not a iot Iago . *stop*
Trust me , I feare it has : I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from your Loue . *stop*
But I do see y'are moou 'd : I am to pray you , not to straine my speech To grosser issues , nor to larger reach , Then to Suspition Oth . *stop*
I will not Iago . *stop*
Should you do so ( my Lord ) My speech should fall into such vilde successe , Which my Thoughts aym 'd not . *stop*
Cassio 's my worthy Friend : My Lord , I see y'are mou'd Oth . *stop*
No , not much mou 'd : I do not thinke but Desdemona 's honest Iago . *stop*
Long liue she so ; And long liue you to thinke so Oth . *stop*
And yet how Nature erring from it selfe Iago . *stop*
I , there 's the point : As ( to be bold with you ) Not to affect many proposed Matches Of her owne Clime , Complexion , and Degree , Whereto we see in all things , Nature tends : Foh , one may smel in such , a will most ranke , Foule disproportions , Thoughts vnnaturall . *stop*
But ( pardon me ) I do not in position Distinctly speake of her , though I may feare Her will , recoyling to her better iudgement , May fal to match you with her Country formes , And happily repent Oth . *stop*
Farewell , farewell : If more thou dost perceiue , let me know more : Set on thy wife to obserue . *stop*
Leaue me Iago Iago . *stop*
My Lord , I take my leaue Othel . *stop*
Why did I marry ? *stop*
This honest Creature ( doubtlesse ) Sees , and knowes more , much more then he vnfolds Iago . *stop*
My Lord , I would I might intreat your Honor To scan this thing no farther : Leaue it to time , Although 't is fit that Cassio haue his Place ; For sure he filles it vp with great Ability ; Yet if you please , to him off a-while : You shall by that perceiue him , and his meanes : Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment With any strong , or vehement importunitie , Much will be seene in that : In the meane time , Let me be thought too busie in my feares , ( As worthy cause I haue to feare I am ) And hold her free , I do beseech your Honor Oth . *stop*
Feare not my gouernment Iago . *stop*
I once more take my leaue . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Oth . *stop*
This Fellow 's of exceeding honesty , And knowes all Quantities with a learn 'd Spirit Of humane dealings . *stop*
If I do proue her Haggard , Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings , I'ld whistle her off , and let her downe the winde To prey at Fortune . *stop*
Haply , for I am blacke , And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation That Chamberers haue : Or for I am declin'd Into the vale of yeares ( yet that 's not much ) Shee 's gone . *stop*
I am abus 'd , and my releefe Must be to loath her . *stop*
Oh Curse of Marriage ! *stop*
That we can call these delicate Creatures ours , And not their Appetites ? *stop*
I had rather be a Toad , And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon , Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue For others vses . *stop*
Yet 't is the plague to Great-ones , Prerogatiu 'd are they lesse then the Base , 'Tis destiny vnshunnable , like death : Euen then , this forked plague is Fated to vs , When we do quicken . *stop*
Looke where she comes : Enter Desdemona and aemilia . *stop*
If she be false , Heauen mock 'd it selfe : Ile not beleeue't Des . *stop*
How now , my deere Othello ? *stop*
Your dinner , and the generous Islanders By you inuited , do attend your presence Oth . *stop*
I am too blame Des . *stop*
Why do you speake so faintly ? *stop*
Are you not well ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
I haue a paine vpon my Forehead , heere Des . *stop*
Why that 's with watching , 'twill away againe . *stop*
Let me but binde it hard , within this houre It will be well Oth . *stop*
Your Napkin is too little : Let it alone : Come , Ile go in with you . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Des . *stop*
I am very sorry that you are not well . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
I am glad I haue found this Napkin : This was her first remembrance from the Moore , My wayward Husband hath a hundred times Woo 'd me to steale it . *stop*
But she so loues the Token , ( For he coniur 'd her , she should euer keepe it ) That she reserues it euermore about her , To kisse , and talke too . *stop*
Ile haue the worke tane out , And giu't Iago : what he will do with it Heauen knowes , not I : I nothing , but to please his Fantasie . *stop*
Enter Iago . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
How now ? *stop*
What do you heere alone ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Do not you chide : I haue a thing for you Iago . *stop*
You haue a thing for me ? *stop*
It is a common thing- Aemil . *stop*
Hah ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
To haue a foolish wife . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Oh , is that all ? *stop*
What will you giue me now For that same Handkerchiefe Iago . *stop*
What Handkerchiefe ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
What Handkerchiefe ? *stop*
Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona , That which so often you did bid me steale Iago . *stop*
Hast stolne it from her ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
No : but she let it drop by negligence , And to th ' aduantage , I being heere , took't vp : Looke , heere 't is Iago . *stop*
A good wench , giue it me . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
What will you do with't , that you haue bene so earnest to haue me filch it ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Why , what is that to you ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
If it be not for some purpose of import , Giu't me againe . *stop*
Poore Lady , shee ' l run mad When she shall lacke it Iago . *stop*
Be not acknowne o n't : I haue vse for it . *stop*
Go , leaue me . *stop*
Exit aemil . *stop*
I will in Cassio 's Lodging loose this Napkin , And let him finde it . *stop*
Trifles light as ayre , Are to the iealious , confirmations strong , As proofes of holy Writ . *stop*
This may do something . *stop*
The Moore already changes with my poyson : Dangerous conceites , are in their Natures poysons , Which at the first are scarse found to distaste : But with a little acte vpon the blood , Burne like the Mines of Sulphure . *stop*
I did say so . *stop*
Enter Othello . *stop*
Looke where he comes : Not Poppy , nor Mandragora , Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe Which thou owd'st yesterday Oth . *stop*
Ha , ha , false to mee ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Why how now Generall ? *stop*
No more of that Oth . *stop*
Auant , be gone : Thou hast set me on the Racke : I sweare 't is better to be much abus 'd , Then but to know't a little Iago . *stop*
How now , my Lord ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
What sense had I , in her stolne houres of Lust ? *stop*
I saw't not , thought it not : it harm 'd not me : I slept the next night well , fed well , was free , and merrie . *stop*
I found not Cassio 's kisses on her Lippes : He that is robb 'd , not wanting what is stolne , Let him not know't , and he 's not robb 'd at all Iago . *stop*
I am sorry to heare this ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
I had beene happy , if the generall Campe , Pyoners and all , had tasted her sweet Body , So I had nothing knowne . *stop*
Oh now , for euer Farewell the Tranquill minde ; farewell Content ; Farewell the plumed Troopes , and the bigge Warres , That makes Ambition , Vertue ! *stop*
Oh farewell , Farewell the neighing Steed , and the shrill Trumpe , The Spirit-stirring Drum , th ' Eare-piercing Fife , The Royall Banner , and all Qualitie , Pride , Pompe , and Circumstance of glorious Warre : And O you mortall Engines , whose rude throates Th ' immortall Ioues dread Clamours , counterfet , Farewell : Othello 's Occupation 's gone Iago . *stop*
Is't possible my Lord ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Villaine , be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore ; Be sure of it : Giue me the Occular proofe , Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule , Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog Then answer my wak 'd wrath Iago . *stop*
Is't come to this ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Make me to see't : or ( at the least ) so proue it , That the probation beare no Hindge , nor Loope , To hang a doubt on : Or woe vpon thy life Iago . *stop*
My Noble Lord Oth . *stop*
If thou dost slander her , and torture me , Neuer pray more : Abandon all remorse On Horrors head , Horrors accumulate : Do deeds to make Heauen weepe , all Earth amaz 'd ; For nothing canst thou to damnation adde , Greater then that Iago . *stop*
O Grace ! *stop*
O Heauen forgiue me ! *stop*
Are you a Man ? *stop*
Haue you a Soule ? *stop*
or Sense ? *stop*
God buy you : take mine Office . *stop*
Oh wretched Foole , That lou'st to make thine Honesty , a Vice ! *stop*
Oh monstrous world ! *stop*
Take note , take note ( O World ) To be direct and honest , is not safe . *stop*
I thanke you for this profit , and from hence Ile loue no Friend , sith Loue breeds such offence Oth . *stop*
Nay stay : thou should'st be honest Iago . *stop*
I should be wise ; for Honestie 's a Foole , And looses that it workes for Oth . *stop*
By the World , I thinke my Wife be honest , and thinke she is not : I thinke that thou art iust , and thinke thou art not : Ile haue some proofe . *stop*
My name that was as fresh As Dians Visage , is now begrim 'd and blacke As mine owne face . *stop*
If there be Cords , or Kniues , Poyson , or Fire , or suffocating streames , Ile not indure it . *stop*
Would I were satisfied Iago . *stop*
I see you are eaten vp with Passion : I do repent me , that I put it to you . *stop*
You would be satisfied ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Would ? *stop*
Nay , and I will Iago . *stop*
And may : but how ? *stop*
How satisfied , my Lord ? *stop*
Would you the super-vision grossely gape on ? *stop*
Behold her top 'd ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Death , and damnation . *stop*
Oh ! *stop*
Iago . *stop*
It were a tedious difficulty , I thinke , To bring them to that Prospect : Damne them then , If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster More then their owne . *stop*
What then ? *stop*
How then ? *stop*
What shall I say ? *stop*
Where 's Satisfaction ? *stop*
It is impossible you should see this , Were they as prime as Goates , as hot as Monkeyes , As salt as Wolues in pride , and Fooles as grosse As Ignorance , made drunke . *stop*
But yet , I say , If imputation , and strong circumstances , Which leade directly to the doore of Truth , Will giue you satisfaction , you might haue't Oth . *stop*
Giue me a liuing reason she 's disloyall Iago . *stop*
I do not like the Office . *stop*
But sith I am entred in this cause so farre ( Prick 'd too't by foolish Honesty , and Loue ) I will go on . *stop*
I lay with Cassio lately , And being troubled with a raging tooth , I could not sleepe . *stop*
There are a kinde of men , So loose of Soule , that in their sleepes will mutter Their Affayres : one of this kinde is Cassio : In sleepe I heard him say , sweet Desdemona , Let vs be wary , let vs hide our Loues , And then ( Sir ) would he gripe , and wring my hand : Cry , oh sweet Creature : then kisse me hard , As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes , That grew vpon my lippes , laid his Leg ore my Thigh , And sigh , and kisse , and then cry cursed Fate , That gaue thee to the Moore Oth . *stop*
O monstrous ! *stop*
monstrous ! *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Nay , this was but his Dreame Oth . *stop*
But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion , 'Tis a shrew 'd doubt , though it be but a Dreame Iago . *stop*
And this may helpe to thicken other proofes , That do demonstrate thinly Oth . *stop*
Ile teare her all to peeces Iago . *stop*
Nay yet be wise ; yet we see nothing done , She may be honest yet : Tell me but this , Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe Spotted with Strawberries , in your wiues hand ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
I gaue her such a one : 't was my first gift Iago . *stop*
I know not that : but such a Handkerchiefe ( I am sure it was your wiues ) did I to day See Cassio wipe his Beard with Oth . *stop*
If it be that Iago . *stop*
If it be that , or any , it was here . *stop*
It speakes against her with the other proofes Othel . *stop*
O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues : One is too poore , too weake for my reuenge . *stop*
Now do I see 't is true . *stop*
Looke heere Iago , All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen . *stop*
'T is gone . *stop*
Arise blacke vengeance , from the hollow hell , Yeeld vp ( O Loue ) thy Crowne , and hearted Throne To tyrannous Hate . *stop*
Swell bosome with thy fraught , For 't is of Aspickes tongues Iago . *stop*
Yet be content Oth . *stop*
Oh blood , blood , blood Iago . *stop*
Patience I say : your minde may change Oth . *stop*
Neuer Iago . *stop*
Like to the Ponticke Sea , Whose Icie Current , and compulsiue course , Neu ' r keepes retyring ebbe , but keepes due on To the Proponticke , and the Hellespont : Euen so my bloody thoughts , with violent pace Shall neu ' r looke backe , neu ' r ebbe to humble Loue , Till that a capeable , and wide Reuenge Swallow them vp . *stop*
Now by yond Marble Heauen , In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow , I heere engage my words Iago . *stop*
Do not rise yet : Witnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue , You Elements , that clip vs round about , Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp The execution of his wit , hands , heart , To wrong 'd Othello 's Seruice . *stop*
Let him command , And to obey shall be in me remorse , What bloody businesse euer Oth . *stop*
I greet thy loue , Not with vaine thanks , but with acceptance bounteous , And will vpon the instant put thee too't . *stop*
Within these three dayes let me heare thee say , That Cassio 's not aliue Iago . *stop*
My Friend is dead : 'Tis done at your Request . *stop*
But let her liue Oth . *stop*
Damne her lewde Minx : O damne her , damne her . *stop*
Come go with me a-part , I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift meanes of death For the faire Diuell . *stop*
Now art thou my Lieutenant Iago . *stop*
I am your owne for euer . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scaena Quarta . *stop*
Enter Desdemona , aemilia , and Clown . *stop*
Des . *stop*
Do you know Sirrah , where Lieutenant Cassio lyes ? *stop*
Clow . *stop*
I dare not say he lies any where Des . *stop*
Why man ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
He 's a Soldier , and for me to say a Souldier lyes , 'tis stabbing Des . *stop*
Go too : where lodges he ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
To tell you where he lodges , is to tel you where I lye Des . *stop*
Can any thing be made of this ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
I know not where he lodges , and for mee to deuise a lodging , and say he lies heere , or he lies there , were to lye in mine owne throat Des . *stop*
Can you enquire him out ? *stop*
and be edified by report ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
I will Catechize the world for him , that is , make Questions , and by them answer Des . *stop*
Seeke him , bidde him come hither : tell him , I haue moou 'd my Lord on his behalfe , and hope all will be well Clo . *stop*
To do this , is within the compasse of mans Wit , and therefore I will attempt the doing it . *stop*
Exit Clo . *stop*
Des . *stop*
Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe , aemilia ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
I know not Madam Des . *stop*
Beleeue me , I had rather haue lost my purse Full of Cruzadoes . *stop*
And but my Noble Moore Is true of minde , and made of no such basenesse , As iealious Creatures are , it were enough To put him to ill-thinking . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Is he not iealious ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Who , he ? *stop*
I thinke the Sun where he was borne , Drew all such humors from him . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Looke where he comes . *stop*
Enter Othello . *stop*
Des . *stop*
I will not leaue him now , till Cassio be Call 'd to him . *stop*
How is't with you , my Lord ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Well my good Lady . *stop*
Oh hardnes to dissemble ! *stop*
How do you , Desdemona ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Well , my good Lord Oth . *stop*
Giue me your hand . *stop*
This hand is moist , my Lady Des . *stop*
It hath felt no age , nor knowne no sorrow Oth . *stop*
This argues fruitfulnesse , and liberall heart : Hot , hot , and moyst . *stop*
This hand of yours requires A sequester from Liberty : Fasting , and Prayer , Much Castigation , Exercise deuout , For heere 's a yong , and sweating Diuell heere That commonly rebels : 'T is a good hand , A franke one Des . *stop*
You may ( indeed ) say so : For 't was that hand that gaue away my heart Oth . *stop*
A liberall hand . *stop*
The hearts of old , gaue hands : But our new Heraldry is hands , not hearts Des . *stop*
I can not speake of this : Come , now your promise Oth . *stop*
What promise , Chucke ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you Oth . *stop*
I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me : Lend me thy Handkerchiefe Des . *stop*
Heere my Lord Oth . *stop*
That which I gaue you Des . *stop*
I haue it not about me Oth . *stop*
Not ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
No indeed , my Lord Oth . *stop*
That 's a fault : That Handkerchiefe Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue : She was a Charmer , and could almost read The thoughts of people . *stop*
She told her , while she kept it , 'T would make her Amiable , and subdue my Father Intirely to her loue : But if she lost it , Or made a Guift of it , my Fathers eye Should hold her loathed , and his Spirits should hunt After new Fancies . *stop*
She dying , gaue it me , And bid me ( when my Fate would haue me Wiu 'd ) To giue it her . *stop*
I did so ; and take heede o n't , Make it a Darling , like your precious eye : To loose't , or giue't away , were such perdition , As nothing else could match Des . *stop*
Is't possible ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
'T is true : There 's Magicke in the web of it : A Sybill that had numbred in the world The Sun to course , two hundred compasses , In her Prophetticke furie sow 'd the Worke : The Wormes were hallowed , that did breede the Silke , And it was dyde in Mummey , which the Skilfull Conseru 'd of Maidens hearts Des . *stop*
Indeed ? *stop*
Is't true ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Most veritable , therefore looke too't well Des . *stop*
Then would to Heauen , that I had neuer seene't ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Ha ? *stop*
wherefore ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Why do you speake so startingly , and rash ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Is't lost ? *stop*
Is't gon ? *stop*
Speak , is't out o'th ' way ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Blesse vs Oth . *stop*
Say you ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
It is not lost : but what and if it were ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
How ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
I say it is not lost Oth . *stop*
Fetcht , let me see't Des . *stop*
Why so I can : but I will not now : This is a tricke to put me from my suite , Pray you let Cassio be receiu 'd againe Oth . *stop*
Fetch me the Handkerchiefe , My minde mis-giues Des . *stop*
Come , come : you ' l neuer meete a more sufficient man Oth . *stop*
The Handkerchiefe Des . *stop*
A man that all his time Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue ; Shar 'd dangers with you Oth . *stop*
The Handkerchiefe Des . *stop*
Insooth , you are too blame Oth . *stop*
Away . *stop*
Exit Othello . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Is not this man iealious ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
I neu ' r saw this before . *stop*
Sure , there 's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe , I am most vnhappy in the losse of it . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
'T is not a yeare or two shewes vs a man : They are all but Stomackes , and we all but Food , They eate vs hungerly , and when they are full They belch vs . *stop*
Enter Iago , and Cassio . *stop*
Looke you , Cassio and my Husband Iago . *stop*
There is no other way : 't is she must doo't : And loe the happinesse : go , and importune her Des . *stop*
How now ( good Cassio ) what 's the newes with you ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Madam , my former suite . *stop*
I do beseech you , That by your vertuous meanes , I may againe Exist , and be a member of his loue , Whom I , with all the Office of my heart Intirely honour , I would not be delayd . *stop*
If my offence , be of such mortall kinde , That nor my Seruice past , nor present Sorrowes , Nor purpos 'd merit in futurity , Can ransome me into his loue againe , But to know so , must be my benefit : So shall I cloath me in a forc 'd content , And shut my selfe vp in some other course To Fortunes Almes Des . *stop*
Alas ( thrice-gentle Cassio ) My Aduocation is not now in Tune ; My Lord , is not my Lord ; nor should I know him , Were he in Fauour , as in Humour alter 'd . *stop*
So helpe me euery spirit sanctified , As I haue spoken for you all my best , And stood within the blanke of his displeasure For my free speech . *stop*
You must awhile be patient : What I can do , I will : and more I will Then for my selfe , I dare . *stop*
Let that suffice you Iago . *stop*
Is my Lord angry ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
He went hence but now : And certainly in strange vnquietnesse Iago . *stop*
Can he be angry ? *stop*
I haue seen the Cannon When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre , And like the Diuell from his very Arme Puff't his owne Brother : And is he angry ? *stop*
Something of moment then : I will go meet him , There 's matter i n't indeed , if he be angry . *stop*
Exit Des . *stop*
I prythee do so . *stop*
Something sure of State , Either from Venice , or some vnhatch 'd practise Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus , to him , Hath pudled his cleare Spirit : and in such cases , Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things , Though great ones are their obiect . *stop*
'T is euen so . *stop*
For let our finger ake , and it endues Our other healthfull members , euen to a sense Of paine . *stop*
Nay , we must thinke men are not Gods , Nor of them looke for such obseruancie As fits the Bridall . *stop*
Beshrew me much , aemilia , I was ( vnhandsome Warrior , as I am ) Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule : But now I finde , I had suborn 'd the Witnesse , And he 's Indited falsely . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Pray heauen it bee State matters , as you thinke , and no Conception , Nor no Iealious Toy , concerning you Des . *stop*
Alas the day , I neuer gaue him cause . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
But Iealious soules will not be answer 'd so ; They are not euer iealious for the cause , But iealious , for they 're iealious . *stop*
It is a Monster Begot vpon it selfe , borne on it selfe Des . *stop*
Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello 's mind . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Lady , Amen Des . *stop*
I will go seeke him . *stop*
Cassio , walke heere about : If I doe finde him fit , Ile moue your suite , And seeke to effect it to my vttermost . *stop*
Exit Cas . *stop*
I humbly thanke your Ladyship . *stop*
Enter Bianca . *stop*
Bian . *stop*
'Saue you ( Friend Cassio . ) *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
What make you from home ? *stop*
How is't with you , my most faire Bianca ? *stop*
Indeed ( sweet Loue ) I was comming to your house Bian . *stop*
And I was going to your Lodging , Cassio . *stop*
What ? *stop*
keepe a weeke away ? *stop*
Seuen dayes , and Nights ? *stop*
Eight score eight houres ? *stop*
And Louers absent howres More tedious then the Diall , eight score times ? *stop*
Oh weary reck'ning Cassio . *stop*
Pardon me , Bianca : I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest , But I shall in a more continuate time Strike off this score of absence . *stop*
Sweet Bianca Take me this worke out Bianca . *stop*
Oh Cassio , whence came this ? *stop*
This is some Token from a newer Friend , To the felt-Absence : now I feele a Cause : Is't come to this ? *stop*
Well , well Cassio . *stop*
Go too , woman : Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth , From whence you haue them . *stop*
You are iealious now , That this is from some Mistris , some remembrance ; No , in good troth Bianca Bian . *stop*
Why , who 's is it ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
I know not neither : I found it in my Chamber , I like the worke well ; Ere it be demanded ( As like enough it will ) I would haue it coppied : Take it , and doo't , and leaue me for this time Bian . *stop*
Leaue you ? *stop*
Wherefore ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
I do attend heere on the Generall , And thinke it no addition , nor my wish To haue him see me woman'd Bian . *stop*
Why , I pray you ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Not that I loue you not Bian . *stop*
But that you do not loue me . *stop*
I pray you bring me on the way a little , And say , if I shall see you soone at night ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
'T is but a little way that I can bring you , For I attend heere : But Ile see you soone Bian . *stop*
'T is very good : I must be circumstanc 'd . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
omnes . *stop*
Actus Quartus . *stop*
Scena Prima . *stop*
Enter Othello , and Iago . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Will you thinke so ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Thinke so , Iago ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
What , to kisse in priuate ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
An vnauthoriz 'd kisse ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Or to be naked with her Friend in bed , An houre , or more , not meaning any harme ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Naked in bed ( Iago ) and not meane harme ? *stop*
It is hypocrisie against the Diuell : They that meane vertuously , and yet do so , The Diuell their vertue tempts , and they tempt Heauen Iago . *stop*
If they do nothing , 't is a Veniall slip : But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe Oth . *stop*
What then ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Why then 't is hers ( my Lord ) and being hers , She may ( I thinke ) bestow't on any man Oth . *stop*
She is Protectresse of her honor too : May she giue that ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Her honor is an Essence that 's not seene , They haue it very oft , that haue it not . *stop*
But for the Handkerchiefe Othe . *stop*
By heauen , I would most gladly haue forgot it : Thou saidst ( oh , it comes ore my memorie , As doth the Rauen o 're the infectious house : Boading to all ) he had my Handkerchiefe Iago . *stop*
I : what of that ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
That 's not so good now Iag . *stop*
What if I had said , I had seene him do you wrong ? *stop*
Or heard him say ( as Knaues be such abroad , Who hauing by their owne importunate suit , Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris , Conuinced or supply 'd them , can not chuse But they must blab . ) *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Hath he said any thing ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
He hath ( my Lord ) but be you well assur 'd , No more then he'le vn-sweare Oth . *stop*
What hath he said ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Why , that he did : I know not what he did Othe . *stop*
What ? *stop*
What ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Lye Oth . *stop*
With her ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
With her ? *stop*
On her : what you will Othe . *stop*
Lye with her ? *stop*
lye on her ? *stop*
We say lye on her , when they be-lye-her . *stop*
Lye with her : that 's fullsome : Handkerchiefe : Confessions : Handkerchiefe . *stop*
To confesse , and be hang 'd for his labour . *stop*
First , to be hang 'd , and then to confesse : I tremble at it . *stop*
Nature would not inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion , without some Instruction . *stop*
It is not words that shakes me thus , ( pish ) Noses , Eares , and Lippes : is't possible . *stop*
Confesse ? *stop*
Handkerchiefe ? *stop*
O diuell . *stop*
Falls in a Traunce . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Worke on , My Medicine workes . *stop*
Thus credulous Fooles are caught , And many worthy , and chast Dames euen thus , ( All guiltlesse ) meete reproach : what hoa ? *stop*
My Lord ? *stop*
My Lord , I say : Othello . *stop*
Enter Cassio . *stop*
How now Cassio ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
What 's the matter ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie , This is his second Fit : he had one yesterday Cas . *stop*
Rub him about the Temples Iago . *stop*
The Lethargie must haue his quyet course : If not , he foames at mouth : and by and by Breakes out to sauage madnesse . *stop*
Looke , he stirres : Do you withdraw your selfe a little while , He will recouer straight : when he is gone , I would on great occasion , speake with you . *stop*
How is it Generall ? *stop*
Haue you not hurt your head ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Dost thou mocke me ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I mocke you not , by Heauen : Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man Othe . *stop*
A Horned man 's a Monster , and a Beast Iago . *stop*
Ther 's many a Beast then in a populous Citty , And many a ciuill Monster Othe . *stop*
Did he confesse it ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Good Sir , be a man : Thinke euery bearded fellow that 's but yoak'd May draw with you . *stop*
There 's Millions now aliue , That nightly lye in those vnproper beds , Which they dare sweare peculiar . *stop*
Your case is better . *stop*
Oh , 't is the spight of hell , the Fiends Arch-mock , To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch ; And to suppose her chast . *stop*
No , let me know , And knowing what I am , I know what she shallbe Oth . *stop*
Oh , thou art wise : 't is certaine Iago . *stop*
Stand you a while apart , Confine your selfe but in a patient List , Whil'st you were heere , o're-whelmed with your griefe ( A passion most resulting such a man ) Cassio came hither : I shifted him away , And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie , Bad him anon returne : and heere speake with me , The which he promis 'd . *stop*
Do but encaue your selfe , And marke the Fleeres , the Gybes , and notable Scornes That dwell in euery Region of his face . *stop*
For I will make him tell the Tale anew ; Where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when He hath , and is againe to cope your wife . *stop*
I say , but marke his gesture : marry Patience , Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene , And nothing of a man Othe . *stop*
Do'st thou heare , Iago , I will be found most cunning in my Patience : But ( do'st thou heare ) most bloody Iago . *stop*
That 's not amisse , But yet keepe time in all : will you withdraw ? *stop*
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca , A Huswife that by selling her desires Buyes her selfe Bread , and Cloath . *stop*
It is a Creature That dotes on Cassio , ( as 't is the Strumpets plague To be-guile many , and be be-guil 'd by one ) He , when he heares of her , can not restraine From the excesse of Laughter . *stop*
Heere he comes . *stop*
Enter Cassio . *stop*
As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad : And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue Poore Cassio 's smiles , gestures , and light behauiours Quite in the wrong . *stop*
How do you Lieutenant ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
The worser , that you giue me the addition , Whose want euen killes me Iago . *stop*
Ply Desdemona well , and you are sure o n't : Now , if this Suit lay in Bianca 's dowre , How quickely should you speed ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
Alas poore Caitiffe Oth . *stop*
Looke how he laughes already Iago . *stop*
I neuer knew woman loue man so Cas . *stop*
Alas poore Rogue , I thinke indeed she loues me Oth . *stop*
Now he denies it faintly : and laughes it out Iago . *stop*
Do you heare Cassio ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Now he importunes him To tell it o 're : go too , well said , well said Iago . *stop*
She giues it out , that you shall marry her . *stop*
Do you intend it ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
Ha , ha , ha Oth . *stop*
Do ye triumph , Romaine ? *stop*
do you triumph ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
I marry . *stop*
What ? *stop*
A customer ; prythee beare Some Charitie to my wit , do not thinke it So vnwholesome . *stop*
Ha , ha , ha Oth . *stop*
So , so , so , so : they laugh , that winnes Iago . *stop*
Why the cry goes , that you marry her Cas . *stop*
Prythee say true Iago . *stop*
I am a very Villaine else Oth . *stop*
Haue you scoar 'd me ? *stop*
Well Cas . *stop*
This is the Monkeys owne giuing out : She is perswaded I will marry her Out of her owne loue & flattery , not out of my promise Oth . *stop*
Iago becomes me : now he begins the story Cassio . *stop*
She was heere euen now : she haunts me in euery place . *stop*
I was the other day talking on the Seabanke with certaine Venetians , and thither comes the Bauble , and falls me thus about my neck Oth . *stop*
Crying oh deere Cassio , as it were : his iesture imports it Cassio . *stop*
So hangs , and lolls , and weepes vpon me : So shakes , and pulls me . *stop*
Ha , ha , ha Oth . *stop*
Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber : oh , I see that nose of yours , but not that dogge , I shall throw it to Cassio . *stop*
Well , I must leaue her companie Iago . *stop*
Before me : looke where she comes . *stop*
Enter Bianca . *stop*
Cas . *stop*
'T is such another Fitchew : marry a perfum 'd one ? *stop*
What do you meane by this haunting of me ? *stop*
Bian . *stop*
Let the diuell , and his dam haunt you : what did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe , you gaue me euen now ? *stop*
I was a fine Foole to take it : I must take out the worke ? *stop*
A likely piece of worke , that you should finde it in your Chamber , and know not who left it there . *stop*
This is some Minxes token , & I must take out the worke ? *stop*
There , giue it your Hobbey-horse , wheresoeuer you had it , Ile take out no worke on't Cassio . *stop*
How now , my sweete Bianca ? *stop*
How now ? *stop*
How now ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
By Heauen , that should be my Handkerchiefe Bian . *stop*
If you'le come to supper to night you may , if you will not come when you are next prepar 'd for . *stop*
Exit Iago . *stop*
After her : after her Cas . *stop*
I must , shee ' l rayle in the streets else Iago . *stop*
Will you sup there ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Yes , I intend so Iago . *stop*
Well , I may chance to see you : for I would very faine speake with you Cas . *stop*
Prythee come : will you ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Go too ; say no more Oth . *stop*
How shall I murther him , Iago Iago . *stop*
Did you perceiue how he laugh 'd at his vice ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Oh , Iago Iago . *stop*
And did you see the Handkerchiefe ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Was that mine ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Yours by this hand : and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife : she gaue it him and , he hath giu ' n it his whore Oth . *stop*
I would haue him nine yeeres a killing : A fine woman , a faire woman , a sweete woman ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Nay , you must forget that Othello . *stop*
I , let her rot and perish , and be damn 'd to night , for she shall not liue . *stop*
No , my heart is turn 'd to stone : I strike it , and it hurts my hand . *stop*
Oh , the world hath not a sweeter Creature : she might lye by an Emperours side , and command him Taskes Iago . *stop*
Nay , that 's not your way Othe . *stop*
Hang her , I do but say what she is : so delicate with her Needle : an admirable Musitian . *stop*
Oh she will sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare : of so high and plenteous wit , and inuention ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
She 's the worse for all this Othe . *stop*
Oh , a thousand , a thousand times : And then of so gentle a condition ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I too gentle Othe . *stop*
Nay that 's certaine : But yet the pitty of it , Iago : oh Iago , the pitty of it Iago Iago . *stop*
If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie : giue her pattent to offend , for if it touch not you , it comes neere no body Oth . *stop*
I will chop her into Messes : Cuckold me ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Oh , 't is foule in her Oth . *stop*
With mine Officer ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
That 's fouler Othe . *stop*
Get me some poyson , Iago , this night . *stop*
Ile not expostulate with her : least her body and beautie vnprouide my mind againe : this night Iago Iago . *stop*
Do it not with poyson , strangle her in her bed , Euen the bed she hath contaminated Oth . *stop*
Good , good : The Iustice of it pleases : very good Iago . *stop*
And for Cassio , let me be his vndertaker : You shall heare more by midnight . *stop*
Enter Lodouico , Desdemona , and Attendants . *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Excellent good : What Trumpet is that same ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I warrant something from Venice , 'Tis Lodouico , this , comes from the Duke . *stop*
See , your wife 's with him Lodo . *stop*
Saue you worthy Generall Othe . *stop*
With all my heart Sir Lod . *stop*
The Duke , and the Senators of Venice greet you Othe . *stop*
I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures Des . *stop*
And what 's the newes , good cozen Lodouico Iago . *stop*
I am very glad to see you Signior : Welcome to Cyprus Lod . *stop*
I thanke you : how do 's Lieutenant Cassio ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Liues Sir , Des . *stop*
Cozen , there 's falne betweene him , & my Lord , An vnkind breach : but you shall make all well Othe . *stop*
Are you sure of that ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
My Lord ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
This faile you not to do , as you will- Lod . *stop*
He did not call : he 's busie in the paper , Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord , and Cassio ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
A most vnhappy one : I would do much T ' attone , them , for the loue I beare to Cassio Oth . *stop*
Fire , and brimestone Des . *stop*
My Lord Oth . *stop*
Are you wise ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
What is he angrie ? *stop*
Lod . *stop*
May be the Letter mou 'd him . *stop*
For as I thinke , they do command him home , Deputing Cassio in his Gouernment Des . *stop*
Trust me , I am glad on't Othe . *stop*
Indeed ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
My Lord ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
I am glad to see you mad Des . *stop*
Why , sweete Othello ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Diuell Des . *stop*
I haue not deseru 'd this Lod . *stop*
My Lord , this would not be beleeu 'd in Venice , Though I should sweare I saw't . *stop*
'T is very much , Make her amends : she weepes Othe . *stop*
Oh diuell , diuell : If that the Earth could teeme with womans teares , Each drop she falls , would proue a Crocodile : Out of my sight Des . *stop*
I will not stay to offend you Lod . *stop*
Truely obedient Lady : I do beseech your Lordship call her backe Othe . *stop*
Mistris Des . *stop*
My Lord Othe . *stop*
What would you with her , Sir ? *stop*
Lod . *stop*
Who I , my Lord ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
I , you did wish , that I would make her turne : Sir , she can turne , and turne : and yet go on And turne againe . *stop*
And she can weepe , Sir , weepe . *stop*
And she 's obedient : as you say obedient . *stop*
Very obedient : proceed you in your teares . *stop*
Concerning this Sir , ( oh well-painted passion ) I am commanded home : get you away : Ile send for you anon . *stop*
Sir I obey the Mandate , And will returne to Venice . *stop*
Hence , auaunt : Cassio shall haue my Place . *stop*
And Sir , to night I do entreat , that we may sup together . *stop*
You are welcome Sir to Cyprus . *stop*
Goates , and Monkeys . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Lod . *stop*
Is this the Noble Moore , whom our full Senate Call all in all sufficient ? *stop*
Is this the Nature Whom Passion could not shake ? *stop*
Whose solid vertue The shot of Accident , nor dart of Chance Could neither graze , nor pierce ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
He is much chang'd Lod . *stop*
Are his wits safe ? *stop*
Is he not light of Braine ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
He 's that he is : I may not breath my censure . *stop*
What he might be : if what he might , he is not , I would to heauen he were Lod . *stop*
What ? *stop*
Strike his wife ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
'Faith that was not so well : yet would I knew That stroke would proue the worst Lod . *stop*
Is it his vse ? *stop*
Or did the Letters , worke vpon his blood , And new create his fault ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Alas , alas : It is not honestie in me to speake What I haue seene , and knowne . *stop*
You shall obserue him , And his owne courses will denote him so , That I may saue my speech : do but go after And marke how he continues Lod . *stop*
I am sorry that I am deceiu 'd in him . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Secunda . *stop*
Enter Othello and aemilia . *stop*
Othe . *stop*
You haue seene nothing then ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Nor euer heard : nor euer did suspect Othe . *stop*
Yes , you haue seene Cassio , and she together Aemi . *stop*
But then I saw no harme : and then I heard , Each syllable that breath made vp betweene them Othe . *stop*
What ? *stop*
Did they neuer whisper ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Neuer my Lord Othe . *stop*
Nor send you out o'th ' way ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Neuer Othe . *stop*
To fetch her Fan , her Gloues , her Mask , nor nothing ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Neuer my Lord Othe . *stop*
That 's strange . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
I durst ( my Lord ) to wager , she is honest : Lay downe my Soule at stake : If you thinke other , Remoue your thought . *stop*
It doth abuse your bosome : If any wretch haue put this in your head , Let Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse , For if she be not honest , chaste , and true , There 's no man happy . *stop*
The purest of their Wiues Is foule as Slander Othe . *stop*
Bid her come hither : go . *stop*
Exit aemilia . *stop*
She saies enough : yet she 's a simple Baud That can not say as much . *stop*
This is a subtile Whore : A Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets , And yet she'le kneele , and pray : I haue seene her do't . *stop*
Enter Desdemona , and aemilia . *stop*
Des . *stop*
My Lord , what is your will ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Pray you Chucke come hither Des . *stop*
What is your pleasure ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Let me see your eyes : looke in my face Des . *stop*
What horrible Fancie 's this ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Some of your Function Mistris : Leaue Procreants alone , and shut the doore : Cough , or cry hem ; if any body come : Your Mystery , your Mystery : May dispatch . *stop*
Exit aemi . *stop*
Des . *stop*
Vpon my knee , what doth your speech import ? *stop*
I vnderstand a Fury in your words Othe . *stop*
Why ? *stop*
What art thou ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Your wife my Lord : your true and loyall wife Othello . *stop*
Come sweare it : damne thy selfe , least being like one of Heauen , the diuells themselues should feare to ceaze thee . *stop*
Therefore be double damn 'd : sweare thou art honest Des . *stop*
Heauen doth truely know it Othe . *stop*
Heauen truely knowes , that thou art false as hell Des . *stop*
To whom my Lord ? *stop*
With whom ? *stop*
How am I false ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Ah Desdemon , away , away , away Des . *stop*
Alas the heauy day : why do you weepe ? *stop*
Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord ? *stop*
If happely you my Father do suspect , An Instrument of this your calling backe , Lay not your blame on me : if you haue lost him , I haue lost him too Othe . *stop*
Had it pleas 'd Heauen , To try me with Affliction , had they rain'd All kind of Sores , and Shames on my bare-head : Steep 'd me in pouertie to the very lippes . *stop*
Giuen to Captiuitie , me , and my vtmost hopes , I should haue found in some place of my Soule A drop of patience . *stop*
But alas , to make me The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne , To point his slow , and mouing finger at . *stop*
Yet could I beare that too , well , very well : But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart , Where either I must liue , or beare no life , The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes , Or else dries vp : to be discarded thence , Or keepe it as a Cesterne , for foule Toades To knot and gender in . *stop*
Turne thy complexion there : Patience , thou young and Rose-lip 'd Cherubin , I heere looke grim as hell Des . *stop*
I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest Othe . *stop*
Oh I , as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles , That quicken euen with blowing . *stop*
Oh thou weed : Who art so louely faire , and smell'st so sweete , That the Sense akes at thee , Would thou had'st neuer bin borne Des . *stop*
Alas , what ignorant sin haue I committed ? *stop*
Othe . *stop*
Was this faire Paper ? *stop*
This most goodly Booke Made to write Whore vpon ? *stop*
What commited , Committed ? *stop*
Oh , thou publicke Commoner , I should make very Forges of my cheekes , That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie , Did I but speake thy deedes . *stop*
What commited ? *stop*
Heauen stoppes the Nose at it , and the Moone winks : The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes , Is hush 'd within the hollow Myne of Earth And will not hear't . *stop*
What commited ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
By Heauen you do me wrong Othe . *stop*
Are not you a Strumpet ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
No , as I am a Christian . *stop*
If to preserue this vessell for my Lord , From any other foule vnlawfull touch Be not to be a Strumpet , I am none Othe . *stop*
What , not a Whore ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
No , as I shall be sau'd Othe . *stop*
Is't possible ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Oh Heauen forgiue vs Othe . *stop*
I cry you mercy then . *stop*
I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice , That married with Othello . *stop*
You Mistris , Enter aemilia . *stop*
That haue the office opposite to Saint Peter , And keepes the gate of hell . *stop*
You , you : I you . *stop*
We haue done our course : there 's money for your paines : I pray you turne the key , and keepe our counsaile . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Alas , what do 's this Gentleman conceiue ? *stop*
How do you Madam ? *stop*
how do you my good Lady ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Faith , halfe a sleepe Aemi . *stop*
Good Madam , What 's the matter with my Lord ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
With who ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Why , with my Lord , Madam ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Who is thy Lord ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
He that is yours , sweet Lady Des . *stop*
I haue none : do not talke to me , aemilia , I can not weepe : nor answeres haue I none , But what should go by water . *stop*
Prythee to night , Lay on my bed my wedding sheetes , remember , And call thy husband hither . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Heere 's a change indeed . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Des . *stop*
'T is meete I should be vs 'd so : very meete . *stop*
How haue I bin behau 'd , that he might sticke The small'st opinion on my least misvse ? *stop*
Enter Iago , and aemilia . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
What is your pleasure Madam ? *stop*
How is't with you ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
I can not tell : those that do teach yong Babes Do it with gentle meanes , and easie taskes . *stop*
He might haue chid me so ; for in good faith I am a Child to chiding Iago . *stop*
What is the matter Lady ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Alas ( Iago ) my Lord hath so bewhor 'd her , Throwne such dispight , and heauy termes vpon her That true hearts can not beare it Des . *stop*
Am I that name , Iago ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
What name , ( faire Lady ? ) *stop*
Des . *stop*
Such as she said my Lord did say I was . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
He call 'd her whore : a Begger in his drinke : Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet Iago . *stop*
Why did he so ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
I do not know : I am sure I am none such Iago . *stop*
Do not weepe , do not weepe : alas the day . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches ? *stop*
Her Father ? *stop*
And her Country ? *stop*
And her Friends ? *stop*
To be call 'd Whore ? *stop*
Would it not make one weepe ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
It is my wretched Fortune Iago . *stop*
Beshrew him for't : How comes this Tricke vpon him ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
Nay , Heauen doth know Aemi . *stop*
I will be hang 'd , if some eternall Villaine , Some busie and insinuating Rogue , Some cogging , cozening Slaue , to get some Office , Haue not deuis 'd this Slander : I will be hang 'd else Iago . *stop*
Fie , there is no such man : it is impossible Des . *stop*
If any such there be , Heauen pardon him . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
A halter pardon him : And hell gnaw his bones . *stop*
Why should he call her Whore ? *stop*
Who keepes her companie ? *stop*
What Place ? *stop*
What Time ? *stop*
What Forme ? *stop*
What liklyhood ? *stop*
The Moore 's abus 'd by some most villanous Knaue , Some base notorious Knaue , some scuruy Fellow . *stop*
Oh Heauens , that such companions thou'd'st vnfold , And put in euery honest hand a whip To lash the Rascalls naked through the world , Euen from the East to th ' West Iago . *stop*
Speake within doore . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Oh fie vpon them : some such Squire he was That turn 'd your wit , the seamy-side without , And made you to suspect me with the Moore Iago . *stop*
You are a Foole : go too Des . *stop*
Alas Iago , What shall I do to win my Lord againe ? *stop*
Good Friend , go to him : for by this light of Heauen , I know not how I lost him . *stop*
Heere I kneele : If ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue , Either in discourse of thought , or actuall deed , Or that mine Eyes , mine Eares , or any Sence Delighted them : or any other Forme . *stop*
Or that I do not yet , and euer did , And euer will , ( though he do shake me off To beggerly diuorcement ) Loue him deerely , Comfort forsweare me . *stop*
Vnkindnesse may do much , And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life , But neuer taynt my Loue . *stop*
I can not say Whore , It do 's abhorre me now I speake the word , To do the Act , that might the addition earne , Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me Iago . *stop*
I pray you be content : 't is but his humour : The businesse of the State do 's him offence Des . *stop*
If 'twere no other Iago . *stop*
It is but so , I warrant , Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper : The Messengers of Venice staies the meate , Go in , and weepe not : all things shall be well . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Desdemona and aemilia . *stop*
Enter Rodorigo . *stop*
How now Rodorigo ? *stop*
Rod . *stop*
I do not finde That thou deal'st iustly with me Iago . *stop*
What in the contrarie ? *stop*
Rodori . *stop*
Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise Iago , and rather , as it seemes to me now , keep'st from me all conueniencie , then suppliest me with the least aduantage of hope : I will indeed no longer endure it . *stop*
Nor am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace , what already I haue foolishly suffred Iago . *stop*
Will you heare me Rodorigo ? *stop*
Rodori . *stop*
I haue heard too much : and your words and Performances are no kin together Iago . *stop*
You charge me most vniustly Rodo . *stop*
With naught but truth : I haue wasted my selfe out of my meanes . *stop*
The Iewels you haue had from me to deliuer Desdemona , would halfe haue corrupted a Votarist . *stop*
You haue told me she hath receiu 'd them , and return 'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine respect , and acquaintance , but I finde none Iago . *stop*
Well , go too : very well Rod . *stop*
Very well , go too : I can not go too , ( man ) nor 'tis not very well . *stop*
Nay I think it is scuruy : and begin to finde my selfe fopt in it Iago . *stop*
Very well Rodor . *stop*
I tell you , 't is not very well : I will make my selfe knowne to Desdemona . *stop*
If she will returne me my Iewels , I will giue ouer my Suit , and repent my vnlawfull solicitation . *stop*
If not , assure your selfe , I will seeke satisfaction of you Iago . *stop*
You haue said now Rodo . *stop*
I : and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing Iago . *stop*
Why , now I see there 's mettle in thee : and euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion then euer before : giue me thy hand Rodorigo . *stop*
Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception : but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy Affaire Rod . *stop*
It hath not appeer'd Iago . *stop*
I grant indeed it hath not appeer 'd : and your suspition is not without wit and iudgement . *stop*
But Rodorigo , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer ( I meane purpose , Courage , and Valour ) this night shew it . *stop*
If thou the next night following enioy not Desdemona , take me from this world with Treacherie , and deuise Engines for my life Rod . *stop*
Well : what is it ? *stop*
Is it within , reason and compasse ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Sir , there is especiall Commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello 's place Rod . *stop*
Is that true ? *stop*
Why then Othello and Desdemona returne againe to Venice Iago . *stop*
Oh no : he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the faire Desdemona , vnlesse his abode be lingred heere by some accident . *stop*
Wherein none can be so determinate , as the remouing of Cassio Rod . *stop*
How do you meane remouing him ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Why , by making him vncapable of Othello's place : knocking out his braines Rod . *stop*
And that you would haue me to do Iago . *stop*
I : if you dare do your selfe a profit , and a right . *stop*
He sups to night with a Harlotry : and thither will I go to him . *stop*
He knowes not yet of his Honourable Fortune , if you will watch his going thence ( which I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one ) you may take him at your pleasure . *stop*
I will be neere to second your Attempt , and he shall fall betweene vs. Come , stand not amaz 'd at it , but go along with me : I will shew you such a necessitie in his death , that you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him . *stop*
It is now high supper time : and the night growes to wast . *stop*
About it Rod . *stop*
I will heare further reason for this Iago . *stop*
And you shalbe satisfi 'd . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Tertia . *stop*
Enter Othello , Lodouico , Desdemona , aemilia , and Atendants . *stop*
Lod . *stop*
I do beseech you Sir , trouble your selfe no further Oth . *stop*
Oh pardon me : 'twill do me good to walke Lodoui . *stop*
Madam , good night : I humbly thanke your Ladyship Des . *stop*
Your Honour is most welcome Oth . *stop*
Will you walke Sir ? *stop*
Oh Desdemona Des . *stop*
My Lord Othello . *stop*
Get you to bed on th ' instant , I will be return'd forthwith : dismisse your Attendant there : look't be done . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Des . *stop*
I will my Lord Aem . *stop*
How goes it now ? *stop*
He lookes gentler then he did Des . *stop*
He saies he will returne incontinent , And hath commanded me to go to bed , And bid me to dismisse you Aemi . *stop*
Dismisse me ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
It was his bidding : therefore good aemilia , Giue me my nightly wearing , and adieu . *stop*
We must not now displease him . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
I , would you had neuer seene him Des . *stop*
So would not I : my loue doth so approue him , That euen his stubbornesse , his checks , his frownes , ( Prythee vn-pin me ) haue grace and fauour Aemi . *stop*
I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed Des . *stop*
All 's one : good Father , how foolish are our minds ? *stop*
If I do die before , prythee shrow 'd me In one of these same Sheetes . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Come , come : you talke Des . *stop*
My Mother had a Maid call 'd Barbarie , She was in loue : and he she lou 'd prou 'd mad , And did forsake her . *stop*
She had a Song of Willough , An old thing 't was : but it express 'd her Fortune , And she dy 'd singing it . *stop*
That Song to night , Will not go from my mind : I haue much to do , But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poore Barbarie : prythee dispatch Aemi . *stop*
Shall I go fetch your Night-gowne ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
No , vn-pin me here , This Lodouico is a proper man . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
A very handsome man Des . *stop*
He speakes well . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip Des . *stop*
The poore Soule sat singing , by a Sicamour tree . *stop*
Sing all a greene Willough : Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee , Sing Willough , Willough , Willough . *stop*
The fresh Streames ran by her , and murmur 'd her moanes Sing Willough , & c. Her salt teares fell from her , and softned the stones , Sing Willough , & c. ( Lay by these ) Willough , Willough . *stop*
( Prythee high thee : he'le come anon ) Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland . *stop*
Let no body blame him , his scorne I approue . *stop*
( Nay that 's not next . *stop*
Harke , who is't that knocks ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
It 's the wind Des . *stop*
I call 'd my Loue false Loue : but what said he then ? *stop*
Sing Willough , & c. If I court mo women , you'le couch with mo men . *stop*
So get thee gone , good night : mine eyes do itch : Doth that boade weeping ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
'T is neyther heere , nor there Des . *stop*
I haue heard it said so . *stop*
O these Men , these men ! *stop*
Do'st thou in conscience thinke ( tell me aemilia ) That there be women do abuse their husbands In such grosse kinde ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
There be some such , no question Des . *stop*
Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Why , would not you ? *stop*
Des . *stop*
No , by this Heauenly light . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Nor I neither , by this Heauenly light : I might doo't as well i'th ' darke Des . *stop*
Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
The world 's a huge thing : It is a great price , for a small vice Des . *stop*
Introth , I thinke thou would'st not . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Introth I thinke I should , and vndoo't when I had done . *stop*
Marry , I would not doe such a thing for a ioynt Ring , nor for measures of Lawne , nor for Gownes , Petticoats , nor Caps , nor any petty exhibition . *stop*
But for all the whole world : why , who would not make her husband a Cuckold , to make him a Monarch ? *stop*
I should venture Purgatory for't Des . *stop*
Beshrew me , if I would do such a wrong For the whole world . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Why , the wrong is but a wrong i'th ' world ; and hauing the world for your labour , 't is a wrong in your owne world , and you might quickly make it right Des . *stop*
I do not thinke there is any such woman . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Yes , a dozen : and as many to'th ' vantage , as would store the world they plaid for . *stop*
But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults If Wiues do fall : ( Say , that they slacke their duties , And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps ; Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies , Throwing restraint vpon vs : Or say they strike vs , Or scant our former hauing in despight ) Why we haue galles : and though we haue some Grace , Yet haue we some Reuenge . *stop*
Let Husbands know , Their wiues haue sense like them : They see , and smell , And haue their Palats both for sweet , and sowre , As Husbands haue . *stop*
What is it that they do , When they change vs for others ? *stop*
Is it Sport ? *stop*
I thinke it is : and doth Affection breed it ? *stop*
I thinke it doth . *stop*
Is't Frailty that thus erres ? *stop*
It is so too . *stop*
And haue not we Affections ? *stop*
Desires for Sport ? *stop*
and Frailty , as men haue ? *stop*
Then let them vse vs well : else let them know , The illes we do , their illes instruct vs so Des . *stop*
Good night , good night : Heauen me such vses send , Not to picke bad , from bad ; but by bad , mend . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Actus Quintus . *stop*
Scena Prima . *stop*
Enter Iago , and Rodorigo . *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Heere , stand behinde this Barke , Straight will he come : Weare thy good Rapier bare , and put it home : Quicke , quicke , feare nothing ; Ile be at thy Elbow , It makes vs , or it marres vs , thinke on that , And fixe most firme thy Resolution Rod . *stop*
Be neere at hand , I may miscarry in't Iago . *stop*
Heere , at thy hand : Be bold , & take thy stand Rod . *stop*
I haue no great deuotion to the deed , And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons : 'Tis but a man gone . *stop*
Forth my Sword : he dies Iago . *stop*
I haue rub 'd this yong Quat almost to the sense , And he growes angry . *stop*
Now , whether he kill Cassio , Or Cassio him , or each do kill the other , Euery way makes my gaine . *stop*
Liue Rodorigo , He calles me to a restitution large Of Gold , and Iewels , that I bob 'd from him , As Guifts to Desdemona . *stop*
It must not be : If Cassio do remaine , He hath a dayly beauty in his life , That makes me vgly : and besides , the Moore May vnfold me to him : there stand I in much perill : No , he must dye . *stop*
But so , I heard him comming . *stop*
Enter Cassio . *stop*
Rod . *stop*
I know his gate , 't is he : Villaine thou dyest Cas . *stop*

'T is he : O braue Iago , honest , and iust , That hast such Noble sense of thy Friends wrong , Thou teachest me . *stop*
Minion , your deere lyes dead , And your vnblest Fate highes : Strumpet I come : For of my heart , those Charmes thine Eyes , are blotted . *stop*
Thy Bed lust-stain 'd , shall with Lusts blood bee spotted . *stop*
Exit Othello . *stop*
Enter Lodouico and Gratiano . *stop*
Cas . *stop*
What hoa ? *stop*

No passage ? *stop*
Murther , Murther Gra . *stop*

Do not you heare a cry ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
Heere , heere : for heauen sake helpe me Iago . *stop*
What 's the matter ? *stop*

This is Othello 's Ancient , as I take it Lodo . *stop*
The same indeede , a very valiant Fellow Iago . *stop*
What are you heere , that cry so greeuously ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
Iago ? *stop*
Oh I am spoyl 'd , vndone by Villaines : Giue me some helpe Iago . *stop*
O mee , Lieutenant ! *stop*
What Villaines haue done this ? *stop*
Cas . *stop*
I thinke that one of them is heereabout . *stop*
And can not make away Iago . *stop*
Oh treacherous Villaines : What are you there ? *stop*
Come in , and giue some helpe Rod . *stop*
O helpe me there Cassio . *stop*
That 's one of them Iago . *stop*
Oh murd'rous Slaue ! *stop*
O Villaine ! *stop*

O damn 'd Iago ! *stop*
O inhumane Dogge ! *stop*

Kill men i'th ' darke ? *stop*

I cry you mercy : here 's Cassio hurt by Villaines Gra . *stop*

Oh my deere Cassio , My sweet Cassio : Oh Cassio , Cassio , Cassio Iago . *stop*

Alas he faints . *stop*
Oh Cassio , Cassio , Cassio Iago . *stop*
Gentlemen all , I do suspect this Trash To be a party in this Iniurie . *stop*
Patience awhile , good Cassio . *stop*
Come , come ; Lend me a Light : know we this face , or no ? *stop*
Alas my Friend , and my deere Countryman Rodorigo ? *stop*
No : Yes sure : Yes , 't is Rodorigo Gra . *stop*

None in the world : nor do I know the man ? *stop*

Oh beare him o'th ' Ayre . *stop*
Stay you good Gentlemen . *stop*
Looke you pale , Mistris ? *stop*
Do you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye ? *stop*
Nay , if you stare , we shall heare more anon . *stop*
Behold her well : I pray you looke vpon her : Do you see Gentlemen ? *stop*
Nay , guiltinesse will speake Though tongues were out of vse . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Alas , what is the matter ? *stop*
What is the matter , Husband ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
Cassio hath heere bin set on in the darke By Rodorigo , and Fellowes that are scap 'd : He 's almost slaine , and Rodorigo quite dead . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Alas good Gentleman : alas good Cassio Iago . *stop*
This is the fruits of whoring . *stop*
Prythe aemilia , Go know of Cassio where he supt to night . *stop*

Enter Othello , and Desdemona in her bed . *stop*

It is the Cause , it is the Cause ( my Soule ) Let me not name it to you , you chaste Starres , It is the Cause . *stop*
Yet Ile not shed her blood , Nor scarre that whiter skin of hers , then Snow , And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster : Yet she must dye , else shee ' l betray more men : Put out the Light , and then put out the Light : If I quench thee , thou flaming Minister , I can againe thy former light restore , Should I repent me . *stop*
But once put out thy Light , Thou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature , I know not where is that Promethaean heate That can thy Light re-Lume . *stop*
When I haue pluck 'd thy Rose , I can not giue it vitall growth againe , It needs must wither . *stop*
Ile smell thee on the Tree . *stop*
Oh Balmy breath , that dost almost perswade Iustice to breake her Sword . *stop*
One more , one more : Be thus when thou art dead , and I will kill thee , And loue thee after . *stop*
One more , and that 's the last . *stop*
So sweet , was ne 're so fatall . *stop*
I must weepe , But they are cruell Teares : This sorrow 's heauenly , It strikes , where it doth loue . *stop*
She wakes Des . *stop*
Who 's there ? *stop*

Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame : These are portents : but yet I hope , I hope , They do not point on me Oth . *stop*
Peace , and be still Des . *stop*
I will so : What 's the matter ? *stop*

Sweet Soule , take heed , take heed of Periury , Thou art on thy death-bed Des . *stop*

Still as the Graue . *stop*
Shall she come in ? *stop*
Wer't good ? *stop*

If she come in , shee ' l sure speake to my wife : My wife , my wife : what wife ? *stop*
I haue no wife . *stop*
Oh insupportable ! *stop*
Oh heauy houre ! *stop*
Me thinkes , it should be now a huge Eclipse Of Sunne , and Moone ; and that th ' affrighted Globe Did yawne at Alteration . *stop*

Oh good my Lord Oth . *stop*

Aemil . *stop*
But now , my Lord Oth . *stop*
It is the very error of the Moone , She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont , And makes men mad . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Cassio , my Lord , hath kill'd A young Venetian , call 'd Rodorigo Oth . *stop*
Rodorigo kill 'd ? *stop*

Aemil . *stop*
No , Cassio is not kill'd Oth . *stop*

You heare her say her selfe , it was not I. Aemil . *stop*
She said so : I must needs report the truth Oth . *stop*
She 's like a Liar gone to burning hell , 'Twas I that kill 'd her . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Oh the more Angell she , and you the blacker Diuell Oth . *stop*
She turn 'd to folly : and she was a whore . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Thou do'st bely her , and thou art a diuell Oth . *stop*
She was false as water . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Thou art rash as fire , to say That she was false . *stop*
Oh she was heauenly true Oth . *stop*
Cassio did top her : Ask thy husband else . *stop*
O , I were damn 'd beneath all depth in hell : But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds To this extremity . *stop*
Thy Husband knew it all . *stop*

My Husband ? *stop*

Aemil . *stop*
My Husband ? *stop*

I , 't was he that told me on her first , An honest man he is , and hates the slime That stickes on filthy deeds . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
My Husband ? *stop*

What needs this itterance , Woman ? *stop*
I say , thy Husband . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Oh Mistris , Villany hath made mockes with loue : My Husband say she was false ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
He , Woman ; I say thy Husband : Do'st vnderstand the word ? *stop*
My Friend , thy Husband ; honest , honest Iago . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
If he say so , may his pernicious Soule Rot halfe a graine a day : he lyes to'th ' heart , She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine Oth . *stop*
Hah ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Do thy worst : This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen , Then thou was't worthy her Oth . *stop*
Peace , you were best . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm , As I haue to be hurt . *stop*
Oh Gull , oh dolt , As ignorant as durt : thou hast done a deed ( I care not for thy Sword ) Ile make thee known , Though I lost twenty liues . *stop*
Helpe , helpe , hoa , helpe : The Moore hath kill 'd my Mistris . *stop*

Aemil . *stop*
Oh , are you come , Iago : you haue done well , That men must lay their Murthers on your necke Gra . *stop*
What is the matter ? *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
Disproue this Villaine , if thou bee'st a man : He sayes , thou told'st him that his wife was false : I know thou did'st not : thou'rt not such a Villain . *stop*
Speake , for my heart is full Iago . *stop*
I told him what I thought , And told no more Then what he found himselfe was apt , and true . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
But did you euer tell him , She was false ? *stop*
Iago . *stop*
I did . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
You told a Lye an odious damned Lye : Vpon my Soule , a Lye ; a wicked Lye . *stop*

Oh Heauens , forefend Emil . *stop*
And your reports haue set the Murder on Othello . *stop*
Nay stare not Masters , It is true indeede Gra . *stop*

Good Gentlemen , let me haue leaue to speake : 'Tis proper I obey him ; but not now : Perchance Iago , I will ne 're go home Oth . *stop*
Oh , oh , oh Emil . *stop*
Nay , lay thee downe , and roare : For thou hast kill 'd the sweetest innocent , That ere did lift vp eye Oth . *stop*
Oh she was fowle ! *stop*
I scarse did know you Vnkle , there lies your Neece , Whose breath ( indeed ) these hands haue newly stopp 'd : I know this acte shewes horrible and grim Gra . *stop*
Poore Desdemon : I am glad thy Father 's dead , Thy Match was mortall to him : and pure greefe Shore his old thred in twaine . *stop*
Did he liue now , This sight would make him do a desperate turne : Yea , curse his better Angell from his side , And fall to Reprobance Oth . *stop*
'T is pittifull : but yet Iago knowes That she with Cassio , hath the Act of shame A thousand times committed . *stop*
Cassio confest it , And she did gratifie his amorous workes With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue Which I first gaue her : I saw it in his hand : It was a Handkerchiefe , an Antique Token My Father gaue my Mother Emil . *stop*
Oh Heauen ! *stop*

Iago . *stop*
Come , hold your peace Emil . *stop*
'Twill out , 'twill out . *stop*

Be wise , and get you home Emil . *stop*
I will not Gra . *stop*
Fye , your Sword vpon a Woman Emil . *stop*
Oh thou dull Moore , That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of I found by Fortune , and did giue my Husband : For often , with a solemne earnestnesse , ( More then indeed belong 'd to such a Trifle ) He begg 'd of me , to steale't Iago . *stop*
Villanous Whore Emil . *stop*
She giue it Cassio ? *stop*
No , alas I found it , And I did giu't my Husband Iago . *stop*
Filth , thou lyest Emil . *stop*
By Heauen I do not , I do not Gentlemen : Oh murd'rous Coxcombe , what should such a Foole Do with so good a wife ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
Are there no stones in Heauen , But what serues for the Thunder ? *stop*
Precious Villaine Gra . *stop*
The woman falles : Sure he hath kill 'd his Wife Emil . *stop*
I , I : oh lay me by my Mistris side Gra . *stop*
Hee 's gone , but his wife 's kill'd Mon . *stop*
'T is a notorious Villain : take you this weapon Which I haue recouer 'd from the Moore : Come guard the doore without , let him not passe , But kill him rather . *stop*
Ile after that same villaine , For 't is a damned Slaue . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Oth . *stop*
I am not valiant neither : But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword . *stop*
But why should Honor out-liue Honesty ? *stop*
Let it go all . *stop*
Aemil . *stop*
What did thy Song boad Lady ? *stop*
Hearke , canst thou heare me ? *stop*
I will play the Swan , And dye in Musicke : Willough , Willough , Willough . *stop*
Moore , she was chaste : She lou 'd thee , cruell Moore , So come my Soule to blisse , as I speake true : So speaking as I thinke , alas , I dye Oth . *stop*
I haue another weapon in this Chamber , It was a Sword of Spaine , the Ice brookes temper : Oh heere it is : Vnkle I must come forth Gra . *stop*
If thou attempt it , it will cost thee deere ; Thou hast no weapon , and perforce must suffer Oth . *stop*
Looke in vpon me then , and speake with me , Or naked as I am I will assault thee Gra . *stop*
What is the matter ? *stop*
Othel . *stop*
Behold , I haue a weapon : A better neuer did it selfe sustaine Vpon a Soldiers Thigh . *stop*
I haue seene the day , That with this little Arme , and this good Sword , I haue made my way through more impediments Then twenty times your stop . *stop*
But ( oh vaine boast ) Who can controll his Fate ? *stop*
'T is not so now . *stop*
Be not affraid , though you do see me weapon 'd : Heere is my iournies end , heere is my butt And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile . *stop*
Do you go backe dismaid ? *stop*
'T is a lost feare : Man but a Rush against Othello 's brest , And he retires . *stop*
Where should Othello go ? *stop*
Now : how dost thou looke now ? *stop*
Oh ill-Starr 'd wench , Pale as thy Smocke : when we shall meete at compt , This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen , And Fiends will snatch at it . *stop*
Cold , cold , my Girle ? *stop*
Euen like thy Chastity . *stop*
O cursed , cursed Slaue ! *stop*
Whip me ye Diuels , From the possession of this Heauenly sight : Blow me about in windes , roast me in Sulphure , Wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire . *stop*
Oh Desdemon ! *stop*
dead Desdemon : dead . *stop*
Oh , oh ! *stop*
Enter Lodouico , Cassio , Montano , and Iago , with Officers . *stop*
Lod . *stop*
Where is this rash , and most vnfortunate man ? *stop*
Oth . *stop*
That 's he that was Othello : heere I am Lod . *stop*
Where is that Viper ? *stop*
Bring the Villaine forth Oth . *stop*
I look down towards his feet ; but that 's a Fable , If that thou bee'st a Diuell , I can not kill thee Lod . *stop*
Wrench his Sword from him Iago . *stop*
I bleed Sir , but not kill'd Othel . *stop*
I am not sorry neither , Il 'd haue thee liue : For in my sense , 't is happinesse to die Lod . *stop*
Oh thou Othello , that was once so good , Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue , What shall be saide to thee Oth . *stop*
Why any thing : An honourable Murderer , if you will : For nought I did in hate , but all in Honour Lod . *stop*
This wretch hath part confest his Villany : Did you and he consent in Cassio 's death Oth . *stop*
I Cas . *stop*
Deere Generall , I neuer gaue you cause Oth . *stop*
I do beleeue it , and I aske your pardon : Will you , I pray , demand that demy-Diuell , Why he hath thus ensnar 'd my Soule and Body Iag . *stop*
Demand me nothing : what you know , you know : From this time forth , I neuer will speake word Lod . *stop*
What ? *stop*
not to pray ? *stop*
Gra . *stop*
Torments will ope your lips Oth . *stop*
Well , thou dost best Lod . *stop*
Sir , You shall vnderstand what hath befalne , ( Which , as I thinke , you know not ) heere is a Letter Found in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo , And heere another , the one of them imports The death of Cassio , to be vndertooke By Rodorigo Oth . *stop*
O Villaine ! *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
Most Heathenish , and most grosse Lod . *stop*
Now , heere 's another discontented paper Found in his pocket too : and this it seemes Rodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine : But that ( belike ) Iago in the interim Came in , and satisfi 'd him Oth . *stop*
Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe ; How came you ( Cassio ) by that Handkerchiefe That was my wiues ? *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
I found it in my Chamber : And he himselfe confest it but euen now , That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose , Which wrought to his desire Othel . *stop*
O Foole , foole , foole ! *stop*
Cassio . *stop*
There is besides , in Rodorigo 's Letter , How he vpbraides Iago , that he made him Braue me vpon the Watch : whereon it came That I was cast : and euen but now he spake ( After long seeming dead ) Iago hurt him , Iago set him on Lod . *stop*
You must forsake this roome , and go with vs : Your Power , and your Command is taken off , And Cassio rules in Cyprus . *stop*
For this Slaue , If there be any cunning Crueltie , That can torment him much , and hold him long , It shall be his . *stop*
You shall close Prisoner rest , Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne To the Venetian State . *stop*
Come , bring away Oth . *stop*
Soft you ; a word or two before you goe : I haue done the State some seruice , and they know't : No more of that . *stop*
I pray you in your Letters , When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate , Speake of me , as I am . *stop*
Nothing extenuate , Nor set downe ought in malice . *stop*
Then must you speake , Of one that lou 'd not wisely , but too well : Of one , not easily Iealious , but being wrought , Perplexed in the extreame : Of one , whose hand ( Like the base Iudean ) threw a Pearle away Richer then all his Tribe : Of one , whose subdu 'd Eyes , Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode , Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees Their Medicinable gumme . *stop*
Set you downe this : And say besides , that in Aleppo once , Where a malignant , and a Turbond-Turke Beate a Venetian , and traduc 'd the State , I tooke by th ' throat the circumcised Dogge , And smoate him , thus Lod . *stop*
Oh bloody period Gra . *stop*
All that is spoke , is marr'd Oth . *stop*
I kist thee , ere I kill 'd thee : No way but this , Killing my selfe , to dye vpon a kisse . *stop*
Dyes Cas . *stop*
This did I feare , but thought he had no weapon : For he was great of heart Lod . *stop*
Oh Sparton Dogge : More fell then Anguish , Hunger , or the Sea : Looke on the Tragicke Loading of this bed : This is thy worke : The Obiect poysons Sight , Let it be hid . *stop*
Gratiano , keepe the house , And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore , For they succeede on you . *stop*
To you , Lord Gouernor , Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine : The Time , the Place , the Torture , oh inforce it : My selfe will straight aboord , and to the State , This heauie Act , with heauie heart relate . *stop*
