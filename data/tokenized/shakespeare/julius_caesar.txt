ï » ¿THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR By William Shakespeare SCENE : Rome , the conspirators ' camp near Sardis , and the plains of Philippi . *stop*
ACT I . *stop*
SCENE I. Rome . *stop*
A street . *stop*
Enter Flavius , Marullus , and certain Commoners . *stop*
FLAVIUS . *stop*
Hence , home , you idle creatures , get you home . *stop*
Is this a holiday ? *stop*
What , know you not , Being mechanical , you ought not walk Upon a laboring day without the sign Of your profession ? *stop*
Speak , what trade art thou ? *stop*
FIRST COMMONER . *stop*
Why , sir , a carpenter . *stop*
MARULLUS . *stop*
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule ? *stop*
What dost thou with thy best apparel on ? *stop*
You , sir , what trade are you ? *stop*
SECOND COMMONER . *stop*
Truly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , I am but , as you would say , a cobbler . *stop*
MARULLUS . *stop*
But what trade art thou ? *stop*
Answer me directly . *stop*
SECOND COMMONER . *stop*
A trade , sir , that , I hope , I may use with a safe conscience , which is indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles . *stop*
MARULLUS . *stop*
What trade , thou knave ? *stop*
Thou naughty knave , what trade ? *stop*
SECOND COMMONER . *stop*
Nay , I beseech you , sir , be not out with me ; yet , if you be out , sir , I can mend you . *stop*
MARULLUS . *stop*
What mean'st thou by that ? *stop*
Mend me , thou saucy fellow ! *stop*
SECOND COMMONER . *stop*
Why , sir , cobble you . *stop*
FLAVIUS . *stop*
Thou art a cobbler , art thou ? *stop*
SECOND COMMONER . *stop*
Truly , Sir , all that I live by is with the awl ; I meddle with no tradesman 's matters , nor women 's matters , but with awl . *stop*
I am indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes ; when they are in great danger , I recover them . *stop*
As proper men as ever trod upon neat 's leather have gone upon my handiwork . *stop*
FLAVIUS . *stop*
But wherefore art not in thy shop today ? *stop*
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets ? *stop*
SECOND COMMONER . *stop*
Truly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work . *stop*
But indeed , sir , we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph . *stop*
MARULLUS . *stop*
Wherefore rejoice ? *stop*
What conquest brings he home ? *stop*
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ? *stop*
You blocks , you stones , you worse than senseless things ! *stop*
O you hard hearts , you cruel men of Rome , Knew you not Pompey ? *stop*
Many a time and oft Have you climb 'd up to walls and battlements , To towers and windows , yea , to chimney tops , Your infants in your arms , and there have sat The livelong day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome . *stop*
And when you saw his chariot but appear , Have you not made an universal shout That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores ? *stop*
And do you now put on your best attire ? *stop*
And do you now cull out a holiday ? *stop*
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey 's blood ? *stop*
Be gone ! *stop*
Run to your houses , fall upon your knees , Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude . *stop*
FLAVIUS . *stop*
Go , go , good countrymen , and , for this fault , Assemble all the poor men of your sort , Draw them to Tiber banks , and weep your tears Into the channel , till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all . *stop*
Exeunt all Commoners . *stop*
See whether their basest metal be not moved ; They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness . *stop*
Go you down that way towards the Capitol ; This way will I. Disrobe the images If you do find them deck 'd with ceremonies . *stop*
MARULLUS . *stop*
May we do so ? *stop*
You know it is the feast of Lupercal . *stop*
FLAVIUS . *stop*
It is no matter ; let no images Be hung with Caesar 's trophies . *stop*
I 'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets ; So do you too , where you perceive them thick . *stop*
These growing feathers pluck 'd from Caesar 's wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch , Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE II . *stop*
A public place . *stop*
Flourish . *stop*
Enter Caesar ; Antony , for the course ; Calpurnia , Portia , Decius , Cicero , Brutus , Cassius , and Casca ; a great crowd follows , among them a Soothsayer . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Calpurnia ! *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Peace , ho ! *stop*
Caesar speaks . *stop*
Music ceases . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Calpurnia ! *stop*
CALPURNIA . *stop*
Here , my lord . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Stand you directly in Antonio 's way , When he doth run his course . *stop*
Antonio ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Caesar , my lord ? *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Forget not in your speed , Antonio , To touch Calpurnia , for our elders say The barren , touched in this holy chase , Shake off their sterile curse . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
I shall remember . *stop*
When Caesar says `` Do this , '' it is perform 'd . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Set on , and leave no ceremony out . *stop*
Flourish . *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
Caesar ! *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Ha ! *stop*
Who calls ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Bid every noise be still . *stop*
Peace yet again ! *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Who is it in the press that calls on me ? *stop*
I hear a tongue , shriller than all the music , Cry `` Caesar . '' *stop*
Speak , Caesar is turn 'd to hear . *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
Beware the ides of March . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
What man is that ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
A soothsayer you beware the ides of March . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Set him before me let me see his face . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Fellow , come from the throng ; look upon Caesar . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
What say'st thou to me now ? *stop*
Speak once again . *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
Beware the ides of March . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
He is a dreamer ; let us leave him . *stop*
Pass . *stop*
Sennet . *stop*
Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Will you go see the order of the course ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Not I. CASSIUS . *stop*
I pray you , do . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I am not gamesome ; I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony . *stop*
Let me not hinder , Cassius , your desires ; I 'll leave you . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Brutus , I do observe you now of late ; I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have ; You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Cassius , Be not deceived ; if I have veil 'd my look , I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself . *stop*
Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference , Conceptions only proper to myself , Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors ; But let not therefore my good friends be grieved- Among which number , Cassius , be you one- Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other men . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Then , Brutus , I have much mistook your passion , By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value , worthy cogitations . *stop*
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
No , Cassius , for the eye sees not itself But by reflection , by some other things . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
'T is just , And it is very much lamented , Brutus , That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow . *stop*
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome , Except immortal Caesar , speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age 's yoke , Have wish 'd that noble Brutus had his eyes . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Into what dangers would you lead me , Cassius , That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Therefore , good Brutus , be prepared to hear , And since you know you can not see yourself So well as by reflection , I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of . *stop*
And be not jealous on me , gentle Brutus ; Were I a common laugher , or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester , if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them , or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout , then hold me dangerous . *stop*
Flourish and shout . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What means this shouting ? *stop*
I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Ay , do you fear it ? *stop*
Then must I think you would not have it so . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I would not , Cassius , yet I love him well . *stop*
But wherefore do you hold me here so long ? *stop*
What is it that you would impart to me ? *stop*
If it be aught toward the general good , Set honor in one eye and death i ' the other And I will look on both indifferently . *stop*
For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I know that virtue to be in you , Brutus , As well as I do know your outward favor . *stop*
Well , honor is the subject of my story . *stop*
I can not tell what you and other men Think of this life , but , for my single self , I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself . *stop*
I was born free as Caesar , so were you ; We both have fed as well , and we can both Endure the winter 's cold as well as he . *stop*
For once , upon a raw and gusty day , The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores , Caesar said to me , `` Darest thou , Cassius , now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point ? '' *stop*
Upon the word , Accoutred as I was , I plunged in And bade him follow . *stop*
So indeed he did . *stop*
The torrent roar 'd , and we did buffet it With lusty sinews , throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy . *stop*
But ere we could arrive the point proposed , Caesar cried , `` Help me , Cassius , or I sink ! *stop*
I , as Aeneas our great ancestor Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear , so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar . *stop*
And this man Is now become a god , and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him . *stop*
He had a fever when he was in Spain , And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake . *stop*
'T is true , this god did shake ; His coward lips did from their color fly , And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster . *stop*
I did hear him groan . *stop*
Ay , and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books , Alas , it cried , `` Give me some drink , Titinius , '' As a sick girl . *stop*
Ye gods ! *stop*
It doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone . *stop*
Shout . *stop*
Flourish . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Another general shout ! *stop*
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heap 'd on Caesar . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Why , man , he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus , and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves . *stop*
Men at some time are masters of their fates : The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , But in ourselves that we are underlings . *stop*
Brutus and Caesar : what should be in that `` Caesar '' ? *stop*
Why should that name be sounded more than yours ? *stop*
Write them together , yours is as fair a name ; Sound them , it doth become the mouth as well ; Weigh them , it is as heavy ; conjure with 'em , `` Brutus '' will start a spirit as soon as `` Caesar . '' *stop*
Now , in the names of all the gods at once , Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great ? *stop*
Age , thou art shamed ! *stop*
Rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods ! *stop*
When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famed with more than with one man ? *stop*
When could they say till now that talk 'd of Rome That her wide walls encompass 'd but one man ? *stop*
Now is it Rome indeed , and room enough , When there is in it but one only man . *stop*
O , you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
That you do love me , I am nothing jealous ; What you would work me to , I have some aim . *stop*
How I have thought of this and of these times , I shall recount hereafter ; for this present , I would not , so with love I might entreat you , Be any further moved . *stop*
What you have said I will consider ; what you have to say I will with patience hear , and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things . *stop*
Till then , my noble friend , chew upon this : Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus . *stop*
Re-enter Caesar and his Train . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
The games are done , and Caesar is returning . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
As they pass by , pluck Casca by the sleeve , And he will , after his sour fashion , tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I will do so . *stop*
But , look you , Cassius , The angry spot doth glow on Caesar 's brow , And all the rest look like a chidden train : Calpurnia 's cheek is pale , and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol , Being cross 'd in conference by some senators . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Casca will tell us what the matter is . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Antonio ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Caesar ? *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Let me have men about me that are fat , Sleek-headed men , and such as sleep o ' nights : Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look ; He thinks too much ; such men are dangerous . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Fear him not , Caesar ; he 's not dangerous ; He is a noble Roman and well given . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Would he were fatter ! *stop*
But I fear him not , Yet if my name were liable to fear , I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius . *stop*
He reads much , He is a great observer , and he looks Quite through the deeds of men . *stop*
He loves no plays , As thou dost , Antony ; he hears no music ; Seldom he smiles , and smiles in such a sort As if he mock 'd himself and scorn 'd his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything . *stop*
Such men as he be never at heart 's ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves , And therefore are they very dangerous . *stop*
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd Than what I fear , for always I am Caesar . *stop*
Come on my right hand , for this ear is deaf , And tell me truly what thou think'st of him . *stop*
Sennet . *stop*
Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
You pull 'd me by the cloak ; would you speak with me ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Ay , Casca , tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Why , you were with him , were you not ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Why , there was a crown offered him , and being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus , and then the people fell ashouting . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What was the second noise for ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Why , for that too . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
They shouted thrice . *stop*
What was the last cry for ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Why , for that too . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Was the crown offered him thrice ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Ay , marry , wast , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Who offered him the crown ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Why , Antony . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Tell us the manner of it , gentle Casca . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
I can as well be hang 'd as tell the manner of it . *stop*
It was mere foolery ; I did not mark it . *stop*
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown ( yet 't was not a crown neither , 't was one of these coronets ) and , as I told you , he put it by once . *stop*
But for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it . *stop*
Then he offered it to him again ; then he put it by again . *stop*
But , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it . *stop*
And then he offered it the third time ; he put it the third time by ; and still as he refused it , the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar , for he swounded and fell down at it . *stop*
And for mine own part , I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
But , soft , I pray you , what , did Caesars wound ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
'T is very like . *stop*
He hath the falling sickness . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
No , Caesar hath it not , but you , and I , And honest Casca , we have the falling sickness . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
I know not what you mean by that , but I am sure Caesar fell down . *stop*
If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them , as they use to do the players in the theatre , I am no true man . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What said he when he came unto himself ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Marry , before he fell down , when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown , he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut . *stop*
An had been a man of any occupation , if I would not have taken him at a word , I would I might go to hell among the rogues . *stop*
And so he fell . *stop*
When he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said anything amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity . *stop*
Three or four wenches where I stood cried , `` Alas , good soul ! '' *stop*
and forgave him with all their hearts . *stop*
But there 's no heed to be taken of them ; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would have done no less . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
And after that he came , thus sad , away ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Ay . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Did Cicero say anything ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Ay , he spoke Greek . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
To what effect ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Nay , an I tell you that , I 'll ne'er look you i ' the face again ; but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads ; but for mine own part , it was Greek to me . *stop*
I could tell you more news too : Marullus and Flavius , for pulling scarfs off Caesar 's images , are put to silence . *stop*
Fare you well . *stop*
There was more foolery yet , if could remember it . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Will you sup with me tonight , Casca ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
No , I am promised forth . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Will you dine with me tomorrow ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Ay , if I be alive , and your mind hold , and your dinner worth the eating . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Good , I will expect you . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Do so , farewell , both . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be ! *stop*
He was quick mettle when he went to school . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise , However he puts on this tardy form . *stop*
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
And so it is . *stop*
For this time I will leave you . *stop*
Tomorrow , if you please to speak with me , I will come home to you , or , if you will , Come home to me and I will wait for you . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I will do so . *stop*
Till then , think of the world . *stop*
Exit Brutus . *stop*
Well , Brutus , thou art noble ; yet , I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed ; therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes ; For who so firm that can not be seduced ? *stop*
Caesar doth bear me hard , but he loves Brutus . *stop*
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius , He should not humor me . *stop*
I will this night , In several hands , in at his windows throw , As if they came from several citizens , Writings , all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name , wherein obscurely Caesar 's ambition shall be glanced at . *stop*
And after this let Caesar seat him sure ; For we will shake him , or worse days endure . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
SCENE III . *stop*
A street . *stop*
Thunder and lightning . *stop*
Enter , from opposite sides , Casca , with his sword drawn , and Cicero . *stop*
CICERO . *stop*
Good even , Casca . *stop*
Brought you Caesar home ? *stop*
Why are you breathless , and why stare you so ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Are not you moved , when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm ? *stop*
O Cicero , I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks , and I have seen The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds , But never till tonight , never till now , Did I go through a tempest dropping fire . *stop*
Either there is a civil strife in heaven , Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destruction . *stop*
CICERO . *stop*
Why , saw you anything more wonderful ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
A common slave- you know him well by sight- Held up his left hand , which did flame and burn Like twenty torches join 'd , and yet his hand Not sensible of fire remain 'd unscorch 'd . *stop*
Besides- I ha ' not since put up my sword- Against the Capitol I met a lion , Who glaz 'd upon me and went surly by Without annoying me . *stop*
And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformed with their fear , who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets . *stop*
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace , Howling and shrieking . *stop*
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet , let not men say `` These are their reasons ; they are natural '' : For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon . *stop*
CICERO . *stop*
Indeed , it is a strange-disposed time . *stop*
But men may construe things after their fashion , Clean from the purpose of the things themselves . *stop*
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
He doth , for he did bid Antonio Send word to you he would be there tomorrow . *stop*
CICERO . *stop*
Good then , Casca . *stop*
This disturbed sky Is not to walk in . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Farewell , Cicero . *stop*
Exit Cicero . *stop*
Enter Cassius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Who 's there ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
A Roman . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Casca , by your voice . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Your ear is good . *stop*
Cassius , what night is this ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
A very pleasing night to honest men . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Who ever knew the heavens menace so ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Those that have known the earth so full of faults . *stop*
For my part , I have walk 'd about the streets , Submitting me unto the perilous night , And thus unbraced , Casca , as you see , Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone ; And when the cross blue lightning seem 'd to open The breast of heaven , I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ? *stop*
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
You are dull , Casca , and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want , Or else you use not . *stop*
You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens . *stop*
But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires , why all these gliding ghosts , Why birds and beasts from quality and kind , Why old men , fools , and children calculate , Why all these things change from their ordinance , Their natures , and preformed faculties To monstrous quality , why , you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state . *stop*
Now could I , Casca , name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night , That thunders , lightens , opens graves , and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol , A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action , yet prodigious grown And fearful , as these strange eruptions are . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
'T is Caesar that you mean , is it not , Cassius ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Let it be who it is , for Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors . *stop*
But , woe the while ! *stop*
Our fathers ' minds are dead , And we are govern 'd with our mothers ' spirits ; Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king , And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I know where I will wear this dagger then : Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius . *stop*
Therein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong ; Therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat . *stop*
Nor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , Nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit ; But life , being weary of these worldly bars , Never lacks power to dismiss itself . *stop*
If I know this , know all the world besides , That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure . *stop*
Thunder still . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
So can I . *stop*
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then ? *stop*
Poor man ! *stop*
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep . *stop*
He were no lion , were not Romans hinds . *stop*
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws . *stop*
What trash is Rome , What rubbish , and what offal , when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar ? *stop*
But , O grief , Where hast thou led me ? *stop*
I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman ; then I know My answer must be made . *stop*
But I am arm 'd , And dangers are to me indifferent . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
You speak to Casca , and to such a man That is no fleering tell-tale . *stop*
Hold , my hand . *stop*
Be factious for redress of all these griefs , And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
There 's a bargain made . *stop*
Now know you , Casca , I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence ; And I do know by this , they stay for me In Pompey 's Porch . *stop*
For now , this fearful night , There is no stir or walking in the streets , And the complexion of the element In favor 's like the work we have in hand , Most bloody , fiery , and most terrible . *stop*
Enter Cinna . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Stand close awhile , for here comes one in haste . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
'T is Cinna , I do know him by his gait ; He is a friend . *stop*
Cinna , where haste you so ? *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
To find out you . *stop*
Who 's that ? *stop*
Metellus Cimber ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
No , it is Casca , one incorporate To our attempts . *stop*
Am I not stay 'd for , Cinna ? *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
I am glad o n't . *stop*
What a fearful night is this ! *stop*
There 's two or three of us have seen strange sights . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Am I not stay 'd for ? *stop*
Tell me . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
Yes , you are . *stop*
O Cassius , if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party- CASSIUS . *stop*
Be you content . *stop*
Good Cinna , take this paper , And look you lay it in the praetor 's chair , Where Brutus may but find it ; and throw this In at his window ; set this up with wax Upon old Brutus ' statue . *stop*
All this done , Repair to Pompey 's Porch , where you shall find us . *stop*
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ? *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
All but Metellus Cimber , and he 's gone To seek you at your house . *stop*
Well , I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
That done , repair to Pompey 's Theatre . *stop*
Exit Cinna . *stop*
Come , Casca , you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house . *stop*
Three parts of him Is ours already , and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
O , he sits high in all the people 's hearts , And that which would appear offense in us , His countenance , like richest alchemy , Will change to virtue and to worthiness . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited . *stop*
Let us go , For it is after midnight , and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

SCENE I . *stop*
Enter Brutus in his orchard . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What , Lucius , ho ! *stop*
I can not , by the progress of the stars , Give guess how near to day . *stop*
Lucius , I say ! *stop*
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly . *stop*
When , Lucius , when ? *stop*
Awake , I say ! *stop*
What , Lucius ! *stop*
Enter Lucius . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Call 'd you , my lord ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Get me a taper in my study , Lucius . *stop*
When it is lighted , come and call me here . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
I will , my lord . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
It must be by his death , and , for my part , I know no personal cause to spurn at him , But for the general . *stop*
He would be crown 'd : How that might change his nature , there 's the question . *stop*
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking . *stop*
Crown him that , And then , I grant , we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with . *stop*
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power , and , to speak truth of Caesar , I have not known when his affections sway'd More than his reason . *stop*
But 't is a common proof That lowliness is young ambition 's ladder , Whereto the climber-upward turns his face ; But when he once attains the upmost round , He then unto the ladder turns his back , Looks in the clouds , scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend . *stop*
So Caesar may ; Then , lest he may , prevent . *stop*
And , since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is , Fashion it thus , that what he is , augmented , Would run to these and these extremities ; And therefore think him as a serpent 's egg Which hatch 'd would as his kind grow mischievous , And kill him in the shell . *stop*
Re-enter Lucius . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
The taper burneth in your closet , sir . *stop*
Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus seal 'd up , and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed . *stop*
Gives him the letter . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Get you to bed again , it is not day . *stop*
Is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of March ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
I know not , sir . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Look in the calendar and bring me word . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
I will , sir . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them . *stop*
Opens the letter and reads . *stop*
`` Brutus , thou sleep'st : awake and see thyself ! *stop*
Shall Rome , etc . *stop*
Speak , strike , redress ! '' *stop*
`` Brutus , thou sleep'st : awake ! '' *stop*
Such instigations have been often dropp'd Where I have took them up . *stop*
`` Shall Rome , etc . '' *stop*
Thus must I piece it out . *stop*
Shall Rome stand under one man 's awe ? *stop*
What , Rome ? *stop*
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive , when he was call 'd a king . *stop*
`` Speak , strike , redress ! '' *stop*
Am I entreated To speak and strike ? *stop*
O Rome , I make thee promise , If the redress will follow , thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus ! *stop*
Re-enter Lucius . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Sir , March is wasted fifteen days . *stop*
Knocking within . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
'T is good . *stop*
Go to the gate , somebody knocks . *stop*
Exit Lucius . *stop*
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept . *stop*
Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion , all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream ; The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council , and the state of man , Like to a little kingdom , suffers then The nature of an insurrection . *stop*
Re-enter Lucius . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Sir , 't is your brother Cassius at the door , Who doth desire to see you . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Is he alone ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
No , sir , there are more with him . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Do you know them ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
No , sir , their hats are pluck 'd about their ears , And half their faces buried in their cloaks , That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Let 'em enter . *stop*
Exit Lucius . *stop*
They are the faction . *stop*
O Conspiracy , Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night , When evils are most free ? *stop*
O , then , by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage ? *stop*
Seek none , Conspiracy ; Hide it in smiles and affability ; For if thou path , thy native semblance on , Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention . *stop*
Enter the conspirators , Cassius , Casca , Decius , Cinna , Metellus Cimber , and Trebonius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I think we are too bold upon your rest . *stop*
Good morrow , Brutus , do we trouble you ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I have been up this hour , awake all night . *stop*
Know I these men that come along with you ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Yes , every man of them , and no man here But honors you , and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you . *stop*
This is Trebonius . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
He is welcome hither . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
This , Decius Brutus . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
He is welcome too . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
This , Casca ; this , Cinna ; and this , Metellus Cimber . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
They are all welcome . *stop*
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Shall I entreat a word ? *stop*
They whisper . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Here lies the east . *stop*
Doth not the day break here ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
No . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
O , pardon , sir , it doth , and yongrey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
You shall confess that you are both deceived . *stop*
Here , as I point my sword , the sun arises , Which is a great way growing on the south , Weighing the youthful season of the year . *stop*
Some two months hence up higher toward the north He first presents his fire , and the high east Stands as the Capitol , directly here . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Give me your hands all over , one by one . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
And let us swear our resolution . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
No , not an oath . *stop*
If not the face of men , The sufferance of our souls , the time 's abuse- If these be motives weak , break off betimes , And every man hence to his idle bed ; So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery . *stop*
But if these , As I am sure they do , bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress ? *stop*
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter ? *stop*
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it ? *stop*
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs ; unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt ; but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise , Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits , To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath ; when every drop of blood That every Roman bears , and nobly bears , Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath pass 'd from him . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
But what of Cicero ? *stop*
Shall we sound him ? *stop*
I think he will stand very strong with us . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Let us not leave him out . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
No , by no means . *stop*
METELLUS . *stop*
O , let us have him , for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion , And buy men 's voices to commend our deeds . *stop*
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands ; Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear , But all be buried in his gravity . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O , name him not ; let us not break with him , For he will never follow anything That other men begin . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Then leave him out . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Indeed he is not fit . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Shall no man else be touch 'd but only Caesar ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Decius , well urged . *stop*
I think it is not meet Mark Antony , so well beloved of Caesar , Should outlive Caesar . *stop*
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver ; and you know his means , If he improve them , may well stretch so far As to annoy us all , which to prevent , Let Antony and Caesar fall together . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Our course will seem too bloody , Caius Cassius , To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards ; For Antony is but a limb of Caesar . *stop*
Let us be sacrificers , but not butchers , Caius . *stop*
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar , And in the spirit of men there is no blood . *stop*
O , that we then could come by Caesar 's spirit , And not dismember Caesar ! *stop*
But , alas , Caesar must bleed for it ! *stop*
And , gentle friends , Let 's kill him boldly , but not wrathfully ; Let 's carve him as a dish fit for the gods , Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds ; And let our hearts , as subtle masters do , Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em . *stop*
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious , Which so appearing to the common eyes , We shall be call 'd purgers , not murderers . *stop*
And for Mark Antony , think not of him , For he can do no more than Caesar 's arm When Caesar 's head is off . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Yet I fear him , For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar- BRUTUS . *stop*
Alas , good Cassius , do not think of him . *stop*
If he love Caesar , all that he can do Is to himself , take thought and die for Caesar . *stop*
And that were much he should , for he is given To sports , to wildness , and much company . *stop*
TREBONIUS . *stop*
There is no fear in him-let him not die , For he will live and laugh at this hereafter . *stop*
Clock strikes . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Peace , count the clock . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
The clock hath stricken three . *stop*
TREBONIUS . *stop*
'T is time to part . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no , For he is superstitious grown of late , Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy , of dreams , and ceremonies . *stop*
It may be these apparent prodigies , The unaccustom 'd terror of this night , And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Never fear that . *stop*
If he be so resolved , I can o'ersway him , for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betray 'd with trees , And bears with glasses , elephants with holes , Lions with toils , and men with flatterers ; But when I tell him he hates flatterers , He says he does , being then most flattered . *stop*
Let me work ; For I can give his humor the true bent , And I will bring him to the Capitol . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
By the eighth hour . *stop*
Is that the utter most ? *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
Be that the uttermost , and fail not then . *stop*
METELLUS . *stop*
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard , Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey . *stop*
I wonder none of you have thought of him . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Now , good Metellus , go along by him . *stop*
He loves me well , and I have given him reasons ; Send him but hither , and I 'll fashion him . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
The morning comes upon 's . *stop*
We 'll leave you , Brutus , And , friends , disperse yourselves , but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily ; Let not our looks put on our purposes , But bear it as our Roman actors do , With untired spirits and formal constancy . *stop*
And so , good morrow to you every one . *stop*
Exeunt all but Brutus . *stop*
Boy ! *stop*
Lucius ! *stop*
Fast asleep ? *stop*
It is no matter . *stop*
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber ; Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies , Which busy care draws in the brains of men ; Therefore thou sleep'st so sound . *stop*
Enter Portia . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Brutus , my lord ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Portia , what mean you ? *stop*
Wherefore rise you now ? *stop*
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Nor for yours neither . *stop*
have ungently , Brutus , Stole from my bed ; and yesternight at supper You suddenly arose and walk 'd about , Musing and sighing , with your arms across ; And when I ask 'd you what the matter was , You stared upon me with ungentle looks . *stop*
I urged you further ; then you scratch 'd your head , And too impatiently stamp 'd with your foot . *stop*
Yet I insisted , yet you answer 'd not , But with an angry waiter of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you . *stop*
So I did , Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem 'd too much enkindled , and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor , Which sometime hath his hour with every man . *stop*
It will not let you eat , nor talk , nor sleep , And , could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevail 'd on your condition , I should not know you , Brutus . *stop*
Dear my lord , Make me acquainted with your cause of grief . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I am not well in health , and that is all . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Brutus is wise , and , were he not in health , He would embrace the means to come by it . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why , so I do . *stop*
Good Portia , go to bed . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Is Brutus sick , and is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humors Of the dank morning ? *stop*
What , is Brutus sick , And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness ? *stop*
No , my Brutus , You have some sick offense within your mind , Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of ; and , upon my knees , I charm you , by my once commended beauty , By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one , That you unfold to me , yourself , your half , Why you are heavy and what men tonight Have had resort to you ; for here have been Some six or seven , who did hide their faces Even from darkness . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Kneel not , gentle Portia . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
I should not need , if you were gentle Brutus . *stop*
Within the bond of marriage , tell me , Brutus , Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you ? *stop*
Am I yourself But , as it were , in sort or limitation , To keep with you at meals , comfort your bed , And talk to you sometimes ? *stop*
Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure ? *stop*
If it be no more , Portia is Brutus ' harlot , not his wife . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
You are my true and honorable wife , As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
If this were true , then should I know this secret . *stop*
I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife . *stop*
I grant I am a woman , but withal A woman well reputed , Cato 's daughter . *stop*
Think you I am no stronger than my sex , Being so father 'd and so husbanded ? *stop*
Tell me your counsels , I will not disclose 'em . *stop*
I have made strong proof of my constancy , Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh . *stop*
Can I bear that with patience And not my husband 's secrets ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O ye gods , Render me worthy of this noble wife ! *stop*
Knocking within . *stop*
Hark , hark , one knocks . *stop*
Portia , go in awhile , And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart . *stop*
All my engagements I will construe to thee , All the charactery of my sad brows . *stop*
Leave me with haste . *stop*
[ Exit Portia . ] *stop*
Lucius , who 's that knocks ? *stop*
Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Here is a sick man that would speak with you . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Caius Ligarius , that Metellus spake of . *stop*
Boy , stand aside . *stop*
Caius Ligarius , how ? *stop*
LIGARIUS . *stop*
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O , what a time have you chose out , brave Caius , To wear a kerchief ! *stop*
Would you were not sick ! *stop*
LIGARIUS . *stop*
I am not sick , if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Such an exploit have I in hand , Ligarius , Had you a healthful ear to hear of it . *stop*
LIGARIUS . *stop*
By all the gods that Romans bow before , I here discard my sickness ! *stop*
Soul of Rome ! *stop*
Brave son , derived from honorable loins ! *stop*
Thou , like an exorcist , hast conjured up My mortified spirit . *stop*
Now bid me run , And I will strive with things impossible , Yea , get the better of them . *stop*
What 's to do ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
A piece of work that will make sick men whole . *stop*
LIGARIUS . *stop*
But are not some whole that we must make sick ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
That must we also . *stop*
What it is , my Caius , I shall unfold to thee , as we are going To whom it must be done . *stop*
LIGARIUS . *stop*
Set on your foot , And with a heart new-fired I follow you , To do I know not what ; but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Follow me then . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE II . *stop*
Caesar 's house . *stop*
Thunder and lightning . *stop*
Enter Caesar , in his nightgown . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight . *stop*
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out , `` Help , ho ! *stop*
They murther Caesar ! '' *stop*
Who 's within ? *stop*
Enter a Servant . *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
My lord ? *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice , And bring me their opinions of success . *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
I will , my lord . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
Enter Calpurnia . *stop*
CALPURNIA . *stop*
What mean you , Caesar ? *stop*
Think you to walk forth ? *stop*
You shall not stir out of your house today . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Caesar shall forth : the things that threaten 'd me Ne'er look 'd but on my back ; when they shall see The face of Caesar , they are vanished . *stop*
CALPURNIA . *stop*
Caesar , I I stood on ceremonies , Yet now they fright me . *stop*
There is one within , Besides the things that we have heard and seen , Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch . *stop*
A lioness hath whelped in the streets ; And graves have yawn 'd , and yielded up their dead ; Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds , In ranks and squadrons and right form of war , Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol ; The noise of battle hurtled in the air , Horses did neigh and dying men did groan , And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets . *stop*
O Caesar ! *stop*
These things are beyond all use , And I do fear them . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods ? *stop*
Yet Caesar shall go forth , for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar . *stop*
CALPURNIA . *stop*
When beggars die , there are no comets seen ; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Cowards die many times before their deaths ; The valiant never taste of death but once . *stop*
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard , It seems to me most strange that men should fear Seeing that death , a necessary end , Will come when it will come . *stop*
Re-enter Servant . *stop*
What say the augurers ? *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
They would not have you to stir forth today . *stop*
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth , They could not find a heart within the beast . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
The gods do this in shame of cowardice . *stop*
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear . *stop*
No , Caesar shall not . *stop*
Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he . *stop*
We are two lions litter 'd in one day , And I the elder and more terrible . *stop*
And Caesar shall go forth . *stop*
CALPURNIA . *stop*
Alas , my lord , Your wisdom is consumed in confidence . *stop*
Do not go forth today . *stop*
Call it my fear That keeps you in the house and not your own . *stop*
We 'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House , And he shall say you are not well today . *stop*
Let me , upon my knee , prevail in this . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Mark Antony shall say I am not well , And , for thy humor , I will stay at home . *stop*
Enter Decius . *stop*
Here 's Decius Brutus , he shall tell them so . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Caesar , all hail ! *stop*
Good morrow , worthy Caesar ! *stop*
I come to fetch you to the Senate House . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today . *stop*
Can not , is false , and that I dare not , falser : I will not come today . *stop*
Tell them so , Decius . *stop*
CALPURNIA . *stop*
Say he is sick . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Shall Caesar send a lie ? *stop*
Have I in conquest stretch 'd mine arm so far To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth ? *stop*
Decius , go tell them Caesar will not come . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Most mighty Caesar , let me know some cause , Lest I be laugh 'd at when I tell them so . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
The cause is in my will : I will not come , That is enough to satisfy the Senate . *stop*
But , for your private satisfaction , Because I love you , I will let you know . *stop*
Calpurnia here , my wife , stays me at home ; She dreamt tonight she saw my statue , Which , like a fountain with an hundred spouts , Did run pure blood , and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it . *stop*
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent , and on her knee Hath begg 'd that I will stay at home today . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
This dream is all amiss interpreted ; It was a vision fair and fortunate . *stop*
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes , In which so many smiling Romans bathed , Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood , and that great men shall press For tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance . *stop*
This by Calpurnia 's dream is signified . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
And this way have you well expounded it . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
I have , when you have heard what I can say . *stop*
And know it now , the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar . *stop*
If you shall send them word you will not come , Their minds may change . *stop*
Besides , it were a mock Apt to be render 'd , for someone to say `` Break up the Senate till another time , When Caesar 's wife shall meet with better dreams . '' *stop*
If Caesar hide himself , shall they not whisper `` Lo , Caesar is afraid '' ? *stop*
Pardon me , Caesar , for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this , And reason to my love is liable . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
How foolish do your fears seem now , Calpurnia ! *stop*
I am ashamed I did yield to them . *stop*
Give me my robe , for I will go . *stop*
Enter Publius , Brutus , Ligarius , Metellus , Casca , Trebonius , and Cinna . *stop*
And look where Publius is come to fetch me . *stop*
PUBLIUS . *stop*
Good morrow , Caesar . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Welcome , Publius . *stop*
What , Brutus , are you stirr 'd so early too ? *stop*
Good morrow , Casca . *stop*
Caius Ligarius , Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean . *stop*
What is't o'clock ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Caesar , 't is strucken eight . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
I thank you for your pains and courtesy . *stop*
Enter Antony . *stop*
See , Antony , that revels long o ' nights , Is notwithstanding up . *stop*
Good morrow , Antony . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
So to most noble Caesar . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Bid them prepare within . *stop*
I am to blame to be thus waited for . *stop*
Now , Cinna ; now , Metellus ; what , Trebonius , I have an hour 's talk in store for you ; Remember that you call on me today ; Be near me , that I may remember you . *stop*
TREBONIUS . *stop*
Caesar , I will . *stop*
[ Aside . ] *stop*
And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Good friends , go in and taste some wine with me , And we like friends will straightway go together . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
[ Aside . ] *stop*
That every like is not the same , O Caesar , The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon ! *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE III . *stop*
A street near the Capitol . *stop*
Enter Artemidorus , reading paper . *stop*
ARTEMIDORUS . *stop*
`` Caesar , beware of Brutus ; take heed of Cassius ; come not near Casca ; have an eye to Cinna ; trust not Trebonius ; mark well Metellus Cimber ; Decius Brutus loves thee not ; thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius . *stop*
There is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against Caesar . *stop*
If thou beest not immortal , look about you . *stop*
Security gives way to conspiracy . *stop*
The mighty gods defend thee ! *stop*
Thy lover , Artemidorus . '' *stop*
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along , And as a suitor will I give him this . *stop*
My heart laments that virtue can not live Out of the teeth of emulation . *stop*
If thou read this , O Caesar , thou mayest live ; If not , the Fates with traitors do contrive . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
SCENE IV . *stop*
Another part of the same street , before the house of Brutus . *stop*
Enter Portia and Lucius . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
I prithee , boy , run to the Senate House ; Stay not to answer me , but get thee gone . *stop*
Why dost thou stay ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
To know my errand , madam . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
I would have had thee there , and here again , Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there . *stop*
O constancy , be strong upon my side ! *stop*
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue ! *stop*
I have a man 's mind , but a woman 's might . *stop*
How hard it is for women to keep counsel ! *stop*
Art thou here yet ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Madam , what should I do ? *stop*
Run to the Capitol , and nothing else ? *stop*
And so return to you , and nothing else ? *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , For he went sickly forth ; and take good note What Caesar doth , what suitors press to him . *stop*
Hark , boy , what noise is that ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
I hear none , madam . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Prithee , listen well . *stop*
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray , And the wind brings it from the Capitol . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Sooth , madam , I hear nothing . *stop*
Enter the Soothsayer . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Come hither , fellow ; Which way hast thou been ? *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
At mine own house , good lady . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
What is't o'clock ? *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
About the ninth hour , lady . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol ? *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
Madam , not yet . *stop*
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Thou hast some suit to Caesar , hast thou not ? *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
That I have , lady . *stop*
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me , I shall beseech him to befriend himself . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
Why , know'st thou any harm 's intended towards him ? *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
None that I know will be , much that I fear may chance . *stop*
Good morrow to you . *stop*
Here the street is narrow , The throng that follows Caesar at the heels , Of senators , of praetors , common suitors , Will crowd a feeble man almost to death . *stop*
I 'll get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
PORTIA . *stop*
I must go in . *stop*
Ay me , how weak a thing The heart of woman is ! *stop*
O Brutus , The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise ! *stop*
Sure , the boy heard me . *stop*
Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant . *stop*
O , I grow faint . *stop*
Run , Lucius , and commend me to my lord ; Say I am merry . *stop*
Come to me again , And bring me word what he doth say to thee . *stop*
Exeunt severally . *stop*

SCENE I. Rome . *stop*
Before the Capitol ; the Senate sitting above . *stop*
A crowd of people , among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer . *stop*
Flourish . *stop*
Enter Caesar , Brutus , Cassius , Casca , Decius , Metellus , Trebonius , Cinna , Antony , Lepidus , Popilius , Publius , and others . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
The ides of March are come . *stop*
SOOTHSAYER . *stop*
Ay , Caesar , but not gone . *stop*
A Hail , Caesar ! *stop*
Read this schedule . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read , At your best leisure , this his humble suit . *stop*
ARTEMIDORUS . *stop*
O Caesar , read mine first , for mine 's a suit That touches Caesar nearer . *stop*
Read it , great Caesar . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
What touches us ourself shall be last served . *stop*
ARTEMIDORUS . *stop*
Delay not , Caesar ; read it instantly . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
What , is the fellow mad ? *stop*
PUBLIUS . *stop*
Sirrah , give place . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
What , urge you your petitions in the street ? *stop*
Come to the Capitol . *stop*
Caesar goes up to the Senate House , the rest follow . *stop*
POPILIUS . *stop*
I wish your enterprise today may thrive . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
What enterprise , Popilius ? *stop*
POPILIUS . *stop*
Fare you well . *stop*
Advances to Caesar . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What said Popilius Lena ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
He wish 'd today our enterprise might thrive . *stop*
I fear our purpose is discovered . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Look , how he makes to Caesar . *stop*
Mark him . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Casca , Be sudden , for we fear prevention . *stop*
Brutus , what shall be done ? *stop*
If this be known , Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back , For I will slay myself . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Cassius , be constant . *stop*
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes ; For , look , he smiles , and Caesar doth not change . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Trebonius knows his time , for , look you , Brutus , He draws Mark Antony out of the way . *stop*
Exeunt Antony and Trebonius . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Where is Metellus Cimber ? *stop*
Let him And presently prefer his suit to Caesar . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
He is address 'd ; press near and second him . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
Casca , you are the first that rears your hand . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Are we all ready ? *stop*
What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress ? *stop*
METELLUS . *stop*
Most high , most mighty , and most puissant Caesar , Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart . *stop*
Kneels . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
I must prevent thee , Cimber . *stop*
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children . *stop*
Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thaw 'd from the true quality With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words , Low-crooked court'sies , and base spaniel-fawning . *stop*
Thy brother by decree is banished . *stop*
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him , I spurn thee like a cur out of my way . *stop*
Know , Caesar doth not wrong , nor without cause Will he be satisfied . *stop*
METELLUS . *stop*
Is there no voice more worthy than my own , To sound more sweetly in great Caesar 's ear For the repealing of my banish 'd brother ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I kiss thy hand , but not in flattery , Caesar , Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
What , Brutus ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Pardon , Caesar ! *stop*
Caesar , pardon ! *stop*
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
I could be well moved , if I were as you ; If I could pray to move , prayers would move me ; But I am constant as the northern star , Of whose true-fix 'd and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament . *stop*
The skies are painted with unnumber 'd sparks ; They are all fire and every one doth shine ; But there 's but one in all doth hold his place . *stop*
So in the world , 't is furnish 'd well with men , And men are flesh and blood , and apprehensive ; Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank , Unshaked of motion ; and that I am he , Let me a little show it , even in this ; That I was constant Cimber should be banish 'd , And constant do remain to keep him so . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
O Caesar- CAESAR . *stop*
Hence ! *stop*
Wilt thou lift up Olympus ? *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
Great Caesar- CAESAR . *stop*
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel ? *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Speak , hands , for me ! *stop*
Casca first , then the other Conspirators and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar . *stop*
CAESAR . *stop*
Et tu , Brute ? - Then fall , Caesar ! *stop*
Dies . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
Liberty ! *stop*
Freedom ! *stop*
Tyranny is dead ! *stop*
Run hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Some to the common pulpits and cry out `` Liberty , freedom , and enfranchisement ! '' *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
People and senators , be not affrighted , Fly not , stand still ; ambition 's debt is paid . *stop*
CASCA . *stop*
Go to the pulpit , Brutus . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
And Cassius too . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Where 's Publius ? *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
Here , quite confounded with this mutiny . *stop*
METELLUS . *stop*
Stand fast together , lest some friend of Caesar's Should chance- BRUTUS . *stop*
Talk not of standing . *stop*
Publius , good cheer , There is no harm intended to your person , Nor to no Roman else . *stop*
So tell them , Publius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
And leave us , Publius , lest that the people Rushing on us should do your age some mischief . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Do so , and let no man abide this deed But we the doers . *stop*
Re-enter Trebonius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Where is Antony ? *stop*
TREBONIUS . *stop*
Fled to his house amazed . *stop*
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run As it were doomsday . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Fates , we will know your pleasures . *stop*
That we shall die , we know ; 't is but the time And drawing days out that men stand upon . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Why , he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Grant that , and then is death a benefit ; So are we Caesar 's friends that have abridged His time of fearing death . *stop*
Stoop , Romans , stoop , And let us bathe our hands in Caesar 's blood Up to the elbows , and besmear our swords ; Then walk we forth , even to the marketplace , And waving our red weapons o'er our heads , Let 's all cry , `` Peace , freedom , and liberty ! '' *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Stoop then , and wash. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport , That now on Pompey 's basis lies along No worthier than the dust ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
So oft as that shall be , So often shall the knot of us be call'd The men that gave their country liberty . *stop*
DECIUS . *stop*
What , shall we forth ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Ay , every man away . *stop*
Brutus shall lead , and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome . *stop*
Enter a Servant . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Soft , who comes here ? *stop*
A friend of Antony 's . *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
Thus , Brutus , did my master bid me kneel , Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down , And , being prostrate , thus he bade me say : Brutus is noble , wise , valiant , and honest ; Caesar was mighty , bold , royal , and loving . *stop*
Say I love Brutus and I honor him ; Say I fear 'd Caesar , honor 'd him , and loved him . *stop*
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death , Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living , but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith . *stop*
So says my master Antony . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman ; I never thought him worse . *stop*
Tell him , so please him come unto this place , He shall be satisfied and , by my honor , Depart untouch 'd . *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
I 'll fetch him presently . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I know that we shall have him well to friend . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I wish we may , but yet have I a mind That fears him much , and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose . *stop*
Re-enter Antony . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
But here comes Antony . *stop*
Welcome , Mark Antony . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
O mighty Caesar ! *stop*
Dost thou lie so low ? *stop*
Are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , Shrunk to this little measure ? *stop*
Fare thee well . *stop*
I know not , gentlemen , what you intend , Who else must be let blood , who else is rank . *stop*
If I myself , there is no hour so fit As Caesar 's death 's hour , nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords , made rich With the most noble blood of all this world . *stop*
I do beseech ye , if you bear me hard , Now , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke , Fulfill your pleasure . *stop*
Live a thousand years , I shall not find myself so apt to die ; No place will please me so , no means of death , As here by Caesar , and by you cut off , The choice and master spirits of this age . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O Antony , beg not your death of us ! *stop*
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel , As , by our hands and this our present act You see we do , yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done . *stop*
Our hearts you see not ; they are pitiful ; And pity to the general wrong of Rome- As fire drives out fire , so pity pity- Hath done this deed on Caesar . *stop*
For your part , To you our swords have leaden points , Mark Antony ; Our arms in strength of malice , and our hearts Of brothers ' temper , do receive you in With all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignities . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude , beside themselves with fear , And then we will deliver you the cause Why I , that did love Caesar when I struck him , Have thus proceeded . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
I doubt not of your wisdom . *stop*
Let each man render me his bloody hand . *stop*
First , Marcus Brutus , will I shake with you ; Next , Caius Cassius , do I take your hand ; Now , Decius Brutus , yours ; now yours , Metellus ; Yours , Cinna ; and , my valiant Casca , yours ; Though last , not least in love , yours , good Trebonius . *stop*
Gentlemen all- alas , what shall I say ? *stop*
My credit now stands on such slippery ground , That one of two bad ways you must conceit me , Either a coward or a flatterer . *stop*
That I did love thee , Caesar , O , 't is true ! *stop*
If then thy spirit look upon us now , Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace , Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes , Most noble ! *stop*
In the presence of thy corse ? *stop*
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds , Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood , It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies . *stop*
Pardon me , Julius ! *stop*
Here wast thou bay 'd , brave hart , Here didst thou fall , and here thy hunters stand , Sign 'd in thy spoil , and crimson 'd in thy Lethe . *stop*
O world , thou wast the forest to this hart , And this , indeed , O world , the heart of thee . *stop*
How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Mark Antony- ANTONY . *stop*
Pardon me , Caius Cassius . *stop*
The enemies of Caesar shall say this : Then , in a friend , it is cold modesty . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I blame you not for praising Caesar so ; But what compact mean you to have with us ? *stop*
Will you be prick 'd in number of our friends , Or shall we on , and not depend on you ? *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Therefore I took your hands , but was indeed Sway 'd from the point by looking down on Caesar . *stop*
Friends am I with you all and love you all , Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Or else were this a savage spectacle . *stop*
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you , Antony , the son of Caesar , You should be satisfied . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
That 's all I seek ; And am moreover suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace , And in the pulpit , as becomes a friend , Speak in the order of his funeral . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
You shall , Mark Antony . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Brutus , a word with you . *stop*
[ Aside to Brutus . ] *stop*
You know not what you do . *stop*
Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral . *stop*
Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
By your pardon , I will myself into the pulpit first , And show the reason of our Caesar 's death . *stop*
What Antony shall speak , I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission , And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies . *stop*
It shall advantage more than do us wrong . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I know not what may fall ; I like it not . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Mark Antony , here , take you Caesar 's body . *stop*
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us , But speak all good you can devise of Caesar , And say you do't by our permission , Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral . *stop*
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going , After my speech is ended . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Be it so , I do desire no more . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Prepare the body then , and follow us . *stop*
Exeunt all but Antony . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
O , pardon me , thou bleeding piece of earth , That I am meek and gentle with these butchers ! *stop*
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times . *stop*
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood ! *stop*
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy ( Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue ) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men ; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy ; Blood and destruction shall be so in use , And dreadful objects so familiar , That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quarter 'd with the hands of war ; All pity choked with custom of fell deeds , And Caesar 's spirit ranging for revenge , With Ate by his side come hot from hell , Shall in these confines with a monarch 's voice Cry `` Havoc ! '' *stop*
and let slip the dogs of war , That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men , groaning for burial . *stop*
Enter a Servant . *stop*
You serve Octavius Caesar , do you not ? *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
I do , Mark Antony . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome . *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
He did receive his letters , and is coming , And bid me say to you by word of mouth- O Caesar ! *stop*
Sees the body . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Thy heart is big ; get thee apart and weep . *stop*
Passion , I see , is catching , for mine eyes , Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , Began to water . *stop*
Is thy master coming ? *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced . *stop*
Here is a mourning Rome , a dangerous Rome , No Rome of safety for Octavius yet ; Hie hence , and tell him so . *stop*
Yet stay awhile , Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace . *stop*
There shall I try , In my oration , how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men , According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things . *stop*
Lend me your hand . *stop*
Exeunt with Caesar 's body . *stop*
SCENE II . *stop*
The Forum . *stop*
Enter Brutus and Cassius , and a throng of Citizens . *stop*
CITIZENS . *stop*
We will be satisfied ! *stop*
Let us be satisfied ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Then follow me and give me audience , friends . *stop*
Cassius , go you into the other street And part the numbers . *stop*
Those that will hear me speak , let 'em stay here ; Those that will follow Cassius , go with him ; And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar 's death . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
I will hear Brutus speak . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons , When severally we hear them rendered . *stop*
Exit Cassius , with some Citizens . *stop*
Brutus goes into the pulpit . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
The noble Brutus is ascended . *stop*
Silence ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Be patient till the last . *stop*
Romans , countrymen , and lovers ! *stop*
Hear me for my cause , and be silent , that you may hear . *stop*
Believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor , that you may believe . *stop*
Censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses , that you may the better judge . *stop*
If there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar 's , to him I say that Brutus ' love to Caesar was no less than his . *stop*
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar , this is my answer : Not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more . *stop*
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves , than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen ? *stop*
As Caesar loved me , I weep for him ; as he was fortunate , I rejoice at it ; as he was valiant , I honor him ; but as he was ambitious , I slew him . *stop*
There is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his valor , and death for his ambition . *stop*
Who is here so base that would be a bondman ? *stop*
If any , speak , for him have I offended . *stop*
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman ? *stop*
If any , speak , for him have I offended . *stop*
Who is here so vile that will not love his country ? *stop*
If any , speak , for him have I offended . *stop*
I pause for a reply . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
None , Brutus , none . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Then none have I offended . *stop*
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus . *stop*
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol , his glory not extenuated , wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced , for which he suffered death . *stop*
Enter Antony and others , with Caesar 's body . *stop*
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying , a place in the commonwealth , as which of you shall not ? *stop*
With this I depart- that , as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome , I have the same dagger for myself , when it shall please my country to need my death . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Live , Brutus , live , live ! *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Bring him with triumph home unto his house . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Give him a statue with his ancestors . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Let him be Caesar . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
Caesar 's better parts Shall be crown 'd in Brutus . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
We 'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
My countrymen- SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Peace ! *stop*
Silence ! *stop*
Brutus speaks . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Peace , ho ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Good countrymen , let me depart alone , And , for my sake , stay here with Antony . *stop*
Do grace to Caesar 's corse , and grace his speech Tending to Caesar 's glories , which Mark Antony , By our permission , is allow 'd to make . *stop*
I do entreat you , not a man depart , Save I alone , till Antony have spoke . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Stay , ho , and let us hear Mark Antony . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Let him go up into the public chair ; We 'll hear him . *stop*
Noble Antony , go up . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
For Brutus ' sake , I am beholding to you . *stop*
Goes into the pulpit . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
What does he say of Brutus ? *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
He says , for Brutus ' sake , He finds himself beholding to us all . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
This Caesar was a tyrant . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Nay , that 's certain . *stop*
We are blest that Rome is rid of him . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Peace ! *stop*
Let us hear what Antony can say . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
You gentle Romans- ALL . *stop*
Peace , ho ! *stop*
Let us hear him . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears ! *stop*
I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him . *stop*
The evil that men do lives after them , The good is oft interred with their bones ; So let it be with Caesar . *stop*
The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious ; If it were so , it was a grievous fault , And grievously hath Caesar answer 'd it . *stop*
Here , under leave of Brutus and the rest- For Brutus is an honorable man ; So are they all , all honorable men- Come I to speak in Caesar 's funeral . *stop*
He was my friend , faithful and just to me ; But Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man . *stop*
He hath brought many captives home to Rome , Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill . *stop*
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious ? *stop*
When that the poor have cried , Caesar hath wept ; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff : Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , And Brutus is an honorable man . *stop*
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown , Which he did thrice refuse . *stop*
Was this ambition ? *stop*
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , And sure he is an honorable man . *stop*
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke , But here I am to speak what I do know . *stop*
You all did love him once , not without cause ; What cause withholds you then to mourn for him ? *stop*
O judgement , thou art fled to brutish beasts , And men have lost their reason . *stop*
Bear with me ; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar , And I must pause till it come back to me . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
If thou consider rightly of the matter , Caesar has had great wrong . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Has he , masters ? *stop*
I fear there will a worse come in his place . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
Mark 'd ye his words ? *stop*
He would not take the crown ; Therefore 't is certain he was not ambitious . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
If it be found so , some will dear abide it . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Poor soul , his eyes are red as fire with weeping . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
There 's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
Now mark him , he begins again to speak . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world . *stop*
Now lies he there , And none so poor to do him reverence . *stop*
O masters ! *stop*
If I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong , Who , you all know , are honorable men . *stop*
I will not do them wrong ; I rather choose To wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , Than I will wrong such honorable men . *stop*
But here 's a parchment with the seal of Caesar ; I found it in his closet , 't is his will . *stop*
Let but the commons hear this testament- Which , pardon me , I do not mean to read- And they would go and kiss dead Caesar 's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood , Yea , beg a hair of him for memory , And , dying , mention it within their wills , Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
We 'll hear the will . *stop*
Read it , Mark Antony . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
The will , the will ! *stop*
We will hear Caesar 's will . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Have patience , gentle friends , I must not read it ; It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you . *stop*
You are not wood , you are not stones , but men ; And , being men , hearing the will of Caesar , It will inflame you , it will make you mad . *stop*
'T is good you know not that you are his heirs , For if you should , O , what would come of it ! *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
Read the will ; we 'll hear it , Antony . *stop*
You shall read us the will , Caesar 's will . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Will you be patient ? *stop*
Will you stay awhile ? *stop*
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it . *stop*
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabb 'd Caesar ; I do fear it . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
They were traitors . *stop*
Honorable men ! *stop*
ALL . *stop*
The will ! *stop*
The testament ! *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
They were villains , murtherers . *stop*
The will ! *stop*
Read the will ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
You will compel me then to read the will ? *stop*
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar , And let me show you him that made the will . *stop*
Shall I descend ? *stop*
And will you give me leave ? *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Come down . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Descend . *stop*
He comes down from the pulpit . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
You shall have leave . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
A ring , stand round . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Stand from the hearse , stand from the body . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Room for Antony , most noble Antony . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Nay , press not so upon me , stand far off . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Stand back ; room , bear back ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
If you have tears , prepare to shed them now . *stop*
You all do know this mantle . *stop*
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on ; 'T was on a summer 's evening , in his tent , That day he overcame the Nervii . *stop*
Look , in this place ran Cassius ' dagger through ; See what a rent the envious Casca made ; Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb 'd ; And as he pluck 'd his cursed steel away , Mark how the blood of Caesar follow 'd it , As rushing out of doors , to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knock 'd , or no ; For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar 's angel . *stop*
Judge , O you gods , how dearly Caesar loved him ! *stop*
This was the most unkindest cut of all ; For when the noble Caesar saw him stab , Ingratitude , more strong than traitors ' arms , Quite vanquish 'd him . *stop*
Then burst his mighty heart , And , in his mantle muffling up his face , Even at the base of Pompey 's statue , Which all the while ran blood , great Caesar fell . *stop*
O , what a fall was there , my countrymen ! *stop*
Then I , and you , and all of us fell down , Whilst bloody treason flourish 'd over us . *stop*
O , now you weep , and I perceive you feel The dint of pity . *stop*
These are gracious drops . *stop*
Kind souls , what weep you when you but behold Our Caesar 's vesture wounded ? *stop*
Look you here , Here is himself , marr 'd , as you see , with traitors . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
O piteous spectacle ! *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
O noble Caesar ! *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
O woeful day ! *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
O traitors villains ! *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
O most bloody sight ! *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
We will be revenged . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Revenge ! *stop*
About ! *stop*
Seek ! *stop*
Burn ! *stop*
Fire ! *stop*
Kill ! *stop*
Slay ! *stop*
Let not a traitor live ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Stay , countrymen . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Peace there ! *stop*
Hear the noble Antony . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
We 'll hear him , we 'll follow him , we 'll die with him . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Good friends , sweet friends , let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny . *stop*
They that have done this deed are honorable . *stop*
What private griefs they have , alas , I know not , That made them do it . *stop*
They are wise and honorable , And will , no doubt , with reasons answer you . *stop*
I come not , friends , to steal away your hearts . *stop*
I am no orator , as Brutus is ; But , as you know me all , a plain blunt man , That love my friend , and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him . *stop*
For I have neither wit , nor words , nor worth , Action , nor utterance , nor the power of speech , To stir men 's blood . *stop*
I only speak right on ; I tell you that which you yourselves do know ; Show you sweet Caesar 's wounds , poor dumb mouths , And bid them speak for me . *stop*
But were I Brutus , And Brutus Antony , there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
We 'll mutiny . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
We 'll burn the house of Brutus . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Away , then ! *stop*
Come , seek the conspirators . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Yet hear me , countrymen ; yet hear me speak . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Peace , ho ! *stop*
Hear Antony , most noble Antony ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Why , friends , you go to do you know not what . *stop*
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves ? *stop*
Alas , you know not ; I must tell you then . *stop*
You have forgot the will I told you of . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Most true , the will ! *stop*
Let 's stay and hear the will . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Here is the will , and under Caesar 's seal . *stop*
To every Roman citizen he gives , To every several man , seventy-five drachmas . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Most noble Caesar ! *stop*
We 'll revenge his death . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
O royal Caesar ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Hear me with patience . *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Peace , ho ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Moreover , he hath left you all his walks , His private arbors , and new-planted orchards , On this side Tiber ; he hath left them you , And to your heirs forever- common pleasures , To walk abroad and recreate yourselves . *stop*
Here was a Caesar ! *stop*
When comes such another ? *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Never , never . *stop*
Come , away , away ! *stop*
We 'll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors ' houses . *stop*
Take up the body . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
Go fetch fire . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Pluck down benches . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
Pluck down forms , windows , anything . *stop*
Exeunt Citizens with the body . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Now let it work . *stop*
Mischief , thou art afoot , Take thou what course thou wilt . *stop*
Enter a Servant . *stop*
How now , fellow ? *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
Sir , Octavius is already come to Rome . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Where is he ? *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
He and Lepidus are at Caesar 's house . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
And thither will I straight to visit him . *stop*
He comes upon a wish . *stop*
Fortune is merry , And in this mood will give us anything . *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Be like they had some notice of the people , How I had moved them . *stop*
Bring me to Octavius . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE III . *stop*
A street . *stop*
Enter Cinna the poet . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar , And things unluckily charge my fantasy . *stop*
I have no will to wander forth of doors , Yet something leads me forth . *stop*
Enter Citizens . *stop*

What is your name ? *stop*

THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Ay , and truly , you were best . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
What is my name ? *stop*
Whither am I going ? *stop*
Where do I dwell ? *stop*
Am I a married man or a bachelor ? *stop*
Then , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly : wisely I say , I am a bachelor . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
That 's as much as to say they are fools that marry . *stop*
You 'll bear me a bang for that , I fear . *stop*
Proceed directly . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
Directly , I am going to Caesar 's funeral . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
As a friend or an enemy ? *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
As a friend . *stop*
SECOND CITIZEN . *stop*
That matter is answered directly . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
For your dwelling , briefly . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
Briefly , I dwell by the Capitol . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Your name , sir , truly . *stop*

Truly , my name is Cinna . *stop*
FIRST CITIZEN . *stop*
Tear him to pieces , he 's a conspirator . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
I am Cinna the poet , I am Cinna the poet . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
Tear him for his bad verses , tear him for his bad verses . *stop*
CINNA . *stop*
I am not Cinna the conspirator . *stop*
FOURTH CITIZEN . *stop*
It is no matter , his name 's Cinna . *stop*
Pluck but his name out of his heart , and turn him going . *stop*
THIRD CITIZEN . *stop*
Tear him , tear him ! *stop*
Come , brands , ho , firebrands . *stop*
To Brutus ' , to Cassius ' ; burn all . *stop*
Some to Decius ' house , and some to Casca 's , some to Ligarius ' . *stop*
Away , go ! *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

SCENE I . *stop*
A house in Rome . *stop*
Antony , Octavius , and Lepidus , seated at a table . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
These many then shall die , their names are prick 'd . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Your brother too must die ; consent you , Lepidus ? *stop*
LEPIDUS . *stop*
I do consent- OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Prick him down , Antony . *stop*
LEPIDUS . *stop*
Upon condition Publius shall not live , Who is your sister 's son , Mark Antony . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
He shall not live ; look , with a spot I damn him . *stop*
But , Lepidus , go you to Caesar 's house , Fetch the will hither , and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies . *stop*
LEPIDUS . *stop*
What , shall I find you here ? *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Or here , or at the Capitol . *stop*
Exit Lepidus . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
This is a slight unmeritable man , Meet to be sent on errands . *stop*
Is it fit , The three-fold world divided , he should stand One of the three to share it ? *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
So you thought him , And took his voice who should be prick 'd to die In our black sentence and proscription . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Octavius , I have seen more days than you , And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , To groan and sweat under the business , Either led or driven , as we point the way ; And having brought our treasure where we will , Then take we down his load and turn him off , Like to the empty ass , to shake his ears And graze in commons . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
You may do your will , But he 's a tried and valiant soldier . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
So is my horse , Octavius , and for that I do appoint him store of provender . *stop*
It is a creature that I teach to fight , To wind , to stop , to run directly on , His corporal motion govern 'd by my spirit . *stop*
And , in some taste , is Lepidus but so : He must be taught , and train 'd , and bid go forth ; A barren-spirited fellow , one that feeds On objects , arts , and imitations , Which , out of use and staled by other men , Begin his fashion . *stop*
Do not talk of him But as a property . *stop*
And now , Octavius , Listen great things . *stop*
Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers ; we must straight make head ; Therefore let our alliance be combined , Our best friends made , our means stretch 'd ; And let us presently go sit in council , How covert matters may be best disclosed , And open perils surest answered . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Let us do so , for we are at the stake , And bay 'd about with many enemies ; And some that smile have in their hearts , I fear , Millions of mischiefs . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE II . *stop*
Camp near Sardis . *stop*
Before Brutus ' tent . *stop*
Drum . *stop*
Enter Brutus , Lucilius , Lucius , and Soldiers ; Titinius and Pindarus meet them . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Stand , ho ! *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
Give the word , ho , and stand . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What now , Lucilius , is Cassius near ? *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
He is at hand , and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
He greets me well . *stop*
Your master , Pindarus , In his own change , or by ill officers , Hath given me some worthy cause to wish Things done undone ; but if he be at hand , I shall be satisfied . *stop*
PINDARUS . *stop*
I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is , full of regard and honor . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
He is not doubted . *stop*
A word , Lucilius , How he received you . *stop*
Let me be resolved . *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
With courtesy and with respect enough , But not with such familiar instances , Nor with such free and friendly conference , As he hath used of old . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling . *stop*
Ever note , Lucilius , When love begins to sicken and decay It useth an enforced ceremony . *stop*
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith ; But hollow men , like horses hot at hand , Make gallant show and promise of their mettle ; But when they should endure the bloody spur , They fall their crests and like deceitful jades Sink in the trial . *stop*
Comes his army on ? *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter 'd ; The greater part , the horse in general , Are come with Cassius . *stop*
Low march within . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Hark , he is arrived . *stop*
March gently on to meet him . *stop*
Enter Cassius and his Powers . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Stand , ho ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Stand , ho ! *stop*
Speak the word along . *stop*
FIRST SOLDIER . *stop*
Stand ! *stop*
SECOND SOLDIER . *stop*
Stand ! *stop*
THIRD SOLDIER . *stop*
Stand ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Judge me , you gods ! *stop*
Wrong I mine enemies ? *stop*
And , if not so , how should I wrong a brother ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Brutus , this sober form of yours hides wrongs , And when you do them- BRUTUS . *stop*
Cassius , be content , Speak your griefs softly , I do know you well . *stop*
Before the eyes of both our armies here , Which should perceive nothing but love from us , Let us not wrangle . *stop*
Bid them move away ; Then in my tent , Cassius , enlarge your griefs , And I will give you audience . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Pindarus , Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Lucilius , do you the like , and let no man Come to our tent till we have done our conference . *stop*
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE III . *stop*
Brutus ' tent . *stop*
Enter Brutus and Cassius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
That you have wrong 'd me doth appear in this : You have condemn 'd and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians , Wherein my letters , praying on his side , Because I knew the man , were slighted off . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
You wrong 'd yourself to write in such a case . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Let me tell you , Cassius , you yourself Are much condemn 'd to have an itching palm , To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I an itching palm ? *stop*
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this , Or , by the gods , this speech were else your last . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
The name of Cassius honors this corruption , And chastisement doth therefore hide his head . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Chastisement ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Remember March , the ides of March remember . *stop*
Did not great Julius bleed for justice ' sake ? *stop*
What villain touch 'd his body , that did stab , And not for justice ? *stop*
What , shall one of us , That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers , shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasped thus ? *stop*
I had rather be a dog , and bay the moon , Than such a Roman . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Brutus , bait not me , I 'll not endure it . *stop*
You forget yourself To hedge me in . *stop*
I am a soldier , I , Older in practice , abler than yourself To make conditions . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Go to , you are not , Cassius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I am . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I say you are not . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Urge me no more , I shall forget myself ; Have mind upon your health , tempt me no farther . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Away , slight man ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Is't possible ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Hear me , for I will speak . *stop*
Must I give way and room to your rash choler ? *stop*
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
O gods , ye gods ! *stop*
Must I endure all this ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
All this ? *stop*
Ay , more . *stop*
Fret till your proud heart break . *stop*
Go show your slaves how choleric you are , And make your bondmen tremble . *stop*
Must I bouge ? *stop*
Must I observe you ? *stop*
Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor ? *stop*
By the gods , You shall digest the venom of your spleen , Though it do split you , for , from this day forth , I 'll use you for my mirth , yea , for my laughter , When you are waspish . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Is it come to this ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
You say you are a better soldier : Let it appear so , make your vaunting true , And it shall please me well . *stop*
For mine own part , I shall be glad to learn of noble men . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
You wrong me every way , you wrong me , Brutus . *stop*
I said , an elder soldier , not a better . *stop*
Did I say `` better '' ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
If you did , I care not . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
When Caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Peace , peace ! *stop*
You durst not so have tempted him . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I durst not ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
No . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
What , durst not tempt him ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
For your life you durst not . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Do not presume too much upon my love ; I may do that I shall be sorry for . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
You have done that you should be sorry for . *stop*
There is no terror , Cassius , in your threats , For I am arm 'd so strong in honesty , That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I respect not . *stop*
I did send to you For certain sums of gold , which you denied me , For I can raise no money by vile means . *stop*
By heaven , I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection . *stop*
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions , Which you denied me . *stop*
Was that done like Cassius ? *stop*
Should I have answer 'd Caius Cassius so ? *stop*
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends , Be ready , gods , with all your thunderbolts , Dash him to pieces ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I denied you not . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
You did . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I did not . *stop*
He was but a fool That brought my answer back . *stop*
Brutus hath rived my heart . *stop*
A friend should bear his friend 's infirmities , But Brutus makes mine greater than they are . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I do not , till you practise them on me . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
You love me not . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I do not like your faults . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
A friendly eye could never see such faults . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
A flatterer 's would not , though they do appear As huge as high Olympus . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Come , Antony , and young Octavius , come , Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius , For Cassius is aweary of the world : Hated by one he loves ; braved by his brother ; Check 'd like a bondman ; all his faults observed , Set in a notebook , learn 'd and conn 'd by rote , To cast into my teeth . *stop*
O , I could weep My spirit from mine eyes ! *stop*
There is my dagger , And here my naked breast ; within , a heart Dearer than Pluto 's mine , richer than gold . *stop*
If that thou best a Roman , take it forth ; I , that denied thee gold , will give my heart . *stop*
Strike , as thou didst at Caesar , for I know , When thou didst hate him worst , thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Sheathe your dagger . *stop*
Be angry when you will , it shall have scope ; Do what you will , dishonor shall be humor . *stop*
O Cassius , you are yoked with a lamb , That carries anger as the flint bears fire , Who , much enforced , shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus , When grief and blood ill-temper 'd vexeth him ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
When I spoke that , I was ill-temper 'd too . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Do you confess so much ? *stop*
Give me your hand . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
And my heart too . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
O Brutus ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What 's the matter ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Yes , Cassius , and from henceforth , When you are overearnest with your Brutus , He 'll think your mother chides , and leave you so . *stop*
POET . *stop*
[ Within . ] *stop*
Let me go in to see the generals . *stop*
There is some grudge between 'em , 't is not meet They be alone . *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
[ Within . ] *stop*
You shall not come to them . *stop*
POET . *stop*
[ Within . ] *stop*
Nothing but death shall stay me . *stop*
Enter Poet , followed by Lucilius , Titinius , and Lucius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
How now , what 's the matter ? *stop*
POET . *stop*
For shame , you generals ! *stop*
What do you mean ? *stop*
Love , and be friends , as two such men should be ; For I have seen more years , I 'm sure , than ye . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Ha , ha ! *stop*
How vilely doth this cynic rhyme ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Get you hence , sirrah ; saucy fellow , hence ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Bear with him , Brutus ; 't is his fashion . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I 'll know his humor when he knows his time . *stop*
What should the wars do with these jigging fools ? *stop*
Companion , hence ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Away , away , be gone ! *stop*
Exit Poet . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Lucilius and Titinius , bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you Immediately to us . *stop*
Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Lucius , a bowl of wine ! *stop*
Exit Lucius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I did not think you could have been so angry . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O Cassius , I am sick of many griefs . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Of your philosophy you make no use , If you give place to accidental evils . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
No man bears sorrow better . *stop*
Portia is dead . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Ha ? *stop*
Portia ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
She is dead . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
How 'scaped killing when I cross 'd you so ? *stop*
O insupportable and touching loss ! *stop*
Upon what sickness ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Impatient of my absence , And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong- for with her death That tidings came- with this she fell distract , And ( her attendants absent ) swallow 'd fire . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
And died so ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Even so . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
O ye immortal gods ! *stop*
Re-enter Lucius , with wine and taper . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Speak no more of her . *stop*
Give me a bowl of wine . *stop*
In this I bury all unkindness , Cassius . *stop*
Drinks . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge . *stop*
Fill , Lucius , till the wine o'erswell the cup ; I can not drink too much of Brutus ' love . *stop*
Drinks . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Come in , Titinius ! *stop*
Exit Lucius . *stop*
Re-enter Titinius , with Messala . *stop*
Welcome , good Messala . *stop*
Now sit we close about this taper here , And call in question our necessities . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Portia , art thou gone ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
No more , I pray you . *stop*
Messala , I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power , Bending their expedition toward Philippi . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
With what addition ? *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
That by proscription and bills of outlawry Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
There in our letters do not well agree ; Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions , Cicero being one . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Cicero one ! *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Cicero is dead , And by that order of proscription . *stop*
Had you your letters from your wife , my lord ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
No , Messala . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Nothing , Messala . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
That , methinks , is strange . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why ask you ? *stop*
Hear you aught of her in yours ? *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
No , my lord . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Now , as you are a Roman , tell me true . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell : For certain she is dead , and by strange manner . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why , farewell , Portia . *stop*
We must die , Messala . *stop*
With meditating that she must die once I have the patience to endure it now . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Even so great men great losses should endure . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I have as much of this in art as you , But yet my nature could not bear it so . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Well , to our work alive . *stop*
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I do not think it good . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Your reason ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
This it is : 'T is better that the enemy seek us ; So shall he waste his means , weary his soldiers , Doing himself offense , whilst we lying still Are full of rest , defense , and nimbleness . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Good reasons must of force give place to better . *stop*
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection , For they have grudged us contribution . *stop*
The enemy , marching along by them , By them shall make a fuller number up , Come on refresh 'd , new-added , and encouraged ; From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there , These people at our back . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Hear me , good brother . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Under your pardon . *stop*
You must note beside That we have tried the utmost of our friends , Our legions are brim-full , our cause is ripe : The enemy increaseth every day ; We , at the height , are ready to decline . *stop*
There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune ; Omitted , all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries . *stop*
On such a full sea are we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves , Or lose our ventures . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Then , with your will , go on ; We 'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
The deep of night is crept upon our talk , And nature must obey necessity , Which we will niggard with a little rest . *stop*
There is no more to say ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
No more . *stop*
Good night . *stop*
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Lucius ! *stop*
Re-enter Lucius . *stop*
My gown . *stop*
Exit Lucius . *stop*
Farewell , good Messala ; Good night , Titinius ; noble , noble Cassius , Good night and good repose . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
O my dear brother ! *stop*
This was an ill beginning of the night . *stop*
Never come such division 'tween our souls ! *stop*
Let it not , Brutus . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Everything is well . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Good night , my lord . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Good night , good brother . *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Good night , Lord Brutus . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Farewell , everyone . *stop*
Exeunt all but Brutus . *stop*
Re-enter Lucius , with the gown . *stop*
Give me the gown . *stop*
Where is thy instrument ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Here in the tent . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
What , thou speak'st drowsily ? *stop*
Poor knave , I blame thee not , thou art o'erwatch 'd . *stop*
Call Claudio and some other of my men , I 'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Varro and Claudio ! *stop*
Enter Varro and Claudio . *stop*
VARRO . *stop*
Calls my lord ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep ; It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius . *stop*
VARRO . *stop*
So please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I would not have it so . *stop*
Lie down , good sirs . *stop*
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me . *stop*
Look Lucius , here 's the book I sought for so ; I put it in the pocket of my gown . *stop*
Varro and Claudio lie down . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
I was sure your lordship did not give it me . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Bear with me , good boy , I am much forgetful . *stop*
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , And touch thy instrument a strain or two ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Ay , my lord , a n't please you . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
It does , my boy . *stop*
I trouble thee too much , but thou art willing . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
It is my duty , sir . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
I should not urge thy duty past thy might ; I know young bloods look for a time of rest . *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
I have slept , my lord , already . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
It was well done , and thou shalt sleep again ; I will not hold thee long . *stop*
If I do live , I will be good to thee . *stop*
Music , and a song . *stop*
This is a sleepy tune . *stop*
O murtherous slumber , Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music ? *stop*
Gentle knave , good night . *stop*
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee . *stop*
If thou dost nod , thou break'st thy instrument ; I 'll take it from thee ; and , good boy , good night . *stop*
Let me see , let me see ; is not the leaf turn 'd down Where I left reading ? *stop*
Here it is , I think . *stop*
Sits down . *stop*
Enter the Ghost of Caesar . *stop*
How ill this taper burns ! *stop*
Ha , who comes here ? *stop*
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition . *stop*
It comes upon me . *stop*
Art thou anything ? *stop*
Art thou some god , some angel , or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare ? *stop*
Speak to me what thou art . *stop*
GHOST . *stop*
Thy evil spirit , Brutus . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why comest thou ? *stop*
GHOST . *stop*
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Well , then I shall see thee again ? *stop*
GHOST . *stop*
Ay , at Philippi . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why , I will see thee at Philippi then . *stop*
Exit Ghost . *stop*
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest . *stop*
Ill spirit , I would hold more talk with thee . *stop*
Boy ! *stop*
Lucius ! *stop*
Varro ! *stop*
Claudio ! *stop*
Sirs , awake ! *stop*
Claudio ! *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
The strings , my lord , are false . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
He thinks he still is at his instrument . *stop*
Lucius , awake ! *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
My lord ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Didst thou dream , Lucius , that thou so criedst out ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
My lord , I do not know that I did cry . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Yes , that thou didst . *stop*
Didst thou see anything ? *stop*
LUCIUS . *stop*
Nothing , my lord . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Sleep again , Lucius . *stop*
Sirrah Claudio ! *stop*
[ To Varro . ] *stop*
Fellow thou , awake ! *stop*
VARRO . *stop*
My lord ? *stop*
CLAUDIO . *stop*
My lord ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ? *stop*
VARRO . *stop*
CLAUDIO . *stop*
Did we , my lord ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Ay , saw you anything ? *stop*
VARRO . *stop*
No , my lord , I saw nothing . *stop*
CLAUDIO . *stop*
Nor I , my lord . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius ; Bid him set on his powers betimes before , And we will follow . *stop*
VARRO . *stop*
CLAUDIO . *stop*
It shall be done , my lord . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*

The plains of Philippi . *stop*
Enter Octavius , Antony , and their Army . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Now , Antony , our hopes are answered . *stop*
You said the enemy would not come down , But keep the hills and upper regions . *stop*
It proves not so . *stop*
Their battles are at hand ; They mean to warn us at Philippi here , Answering before we do demand of them . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Tut , I am in their bosoms , and I know Wherefore they do it . *stop*
They could be content To visit other places , and come down With fearful bravery , thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage ; But 't is not so . *stop*
Enter a Messenger . *stop*
MESSENGER . *stop*
Prepare you , generals . *stop*
The enemy comes on in gallant show ; Their bloody sign of battle is hung out , And something to be done immediately . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Octavius , lead your battle softly on , Upon the left hand of the even field . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Upon the right hand I , keep thou the left . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Why do you cross me in this exigent ? *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
I do not cross you , but I will do so . *stop*
March . *stop*
Drum . *stop*
Enter Brutus , Cassius , and their Army ; Lucilius , Titinius , Messala , and others . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
They stand , and would have parley . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Stand fast , Titinius ; we must out and talk . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Mark Antony , shall we give sign of battle ? *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
No , Caesar , we will answer on their charge . *stop*
Make forth , the generals would have some words . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Stir not until the signal not until the signal . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Words before blows . *stop*
Is it so , countrymen ? *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Not that we love words better , as you do . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
In your bad strokes , Brutus , you give good words . *stop*
Witness the hole you made in Caesar 's heart , Crying `` Long live ! *stop*
Hail , Caesar ! '' *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Antony , The posture of your blows are yet unknown ; But for your words , they rob the Hybla bees , And leave them honeyless . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Not stingless too . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O , yes , and soundless too , For you have stol ' n their buzzing , Antony , And very wisely threat before you sting . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Villains ! *stop*
You did not so when your vile daggers Hack 'd one another in the sides of Caesar . *stop*
You show 'd your teeth like apes , and fawn 'd like hounds , And bow 'd like bondmen , kissing Caesar 's feet ; Whilst damned Casca , like a cur , behind Strooke Caesar on the neck . *stop*
O you flatterers ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Flatterers ? *stop*
Now , Brutus , thank yourself . *stop*
This tongue had not offended so today , If Cassius might have ruled . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Come , come , the cause . *stop*
If arguing make us sweat , The proof of it will turn to redder drops . *stop*
Look , I draw a sword against conspirators ; When think you that the sword goes up again ? *stop*
Never , till Caesar 's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged , or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Caesar , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands , Unless thou bring'st them with thee . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
So I hope , I was not born to die on Brutus ' sword . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , Young man , thou couldst not die more honorable . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
A peevish school boy , worthless of such honor , Join 'd with a masker and a reveler ! *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Old Cassius still ! *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Come , Antony , away ! *stop*
Defiance , traitors , hurl we in your teeth . *stop*
If you dare fight today , come to the field ; If not , when you have stomachs . *stop*
Exeunt Octavius , Antony , and their Army . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Why , now , blow and , swell billow , and swim bark ! *stop*
The storm is up , and all is on the hazard . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Ho , Lucilius ! *stop*
Hark , a word with you . *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
[ Stands forth . ] *stop*
My lord ? *stop*
Brutus and Lucilius converse apart . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Messala ! *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
[ Stands forth . ] *stop*
What says my general ? *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Messala , This is my birthday , as this very day Was Cassius born . *stop*
Give me thy hand , Messala . *stop*
Be thou my witness that , against my will , As Pompey was , am I compell 'd to set Upon one battle all our liberties . *stop*
You know that I held Epicurus strong , And his opinion . *stop*
Now I change my mind , And partly credit things that do presage . *stop*
Coming from Sardis , on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell , and there they perch 'd , Gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands , Who to Philippi here consorted us . *stop*
This morning are they fled away and gone , And in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us , As we were sickly prey . *stop*
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal , under which Our army lies , ready to give up the ghost . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Believe not so . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
I but believe it partly , For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Even so , Lucilius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Now , most noble Brutus , The gods today stand friendly that we may , Lovers in peace , lead on our days to age ! *stop*
But , since the affairs of men rest still incertain , Let 's reason with the worst that may befall . *stop*
If we do lose this battle , then is this The very last time we shall speak together . *stop*
What are you then determined to do ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself- I know not how , But I do find it cowardly and vile , For fear of what might fall , so to prevent The time of life- arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Then , if we lose this battle , You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
No , Cassius , no . *stop*
Think not , thou noble Roman , That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome ; He bears too great a mind . *stop*
But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun . *stop*
And whether we shall meet again I know not . *stop*
Therefore our everlasting farewell take . *stop*
Forever , and forever , farewell , Cassius ! *stop*
If we do meet again , why , we shall smile ; If not , why then this parting was well made . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Forever and forever farewell , Brutus ! *stop*
If we do meet again , we 'll smile indeed ; If not , 't is true this parting was well made . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why then , lead on . *stop*
O , that a man might know The end of this day 's business ere it come ! *stop*
But it sufficeth that the day will end , And then the end is known . *stop*
Come , ho ! *stop*
Away ! *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE II . *stop*
The field of battle . *stop*
Alarum . *stop*
Enter Brutus and Messala . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side . *stop*
Loud alarum . *stop*
Let them set on at once , for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavia 's wing , And sudden push gives them the overthrow . *stop*
Ride , ride , Messala . *stop*
Let them all come down . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE III . *stop*
Another part of the field . *stop*
Alarums . *stop*
Enter Cassius and Titinius . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
O , look , Titinius , look , the villains fly ! *stop*
Myself have to mine own turn 'd enemy . *stop*
This ensign here of mine was turning back ; I slew the coward , and did take it from him . *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
O Cassius , Brutus gave the word too early , Who , having some advantage on Octavius , Took it too eagerly . *stop*
His soldiers fell to spoil , Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed . *stop*
Enter Pindarus . *stop*
PINDARUS . *stop*
Fly further off , my lord , fly further off ; Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord ; Fly , therefore , noble Cassius , fly far off . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
This hill is far enough . *stop*
Look , look , Titinius : Are those my tents where I perceive the fire ? *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
They are , my lord . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Titinius , if thou lovest me , Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him , Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again , that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy . *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
I will be here again , even with a thought . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Go , Pindarus , get higher on that hill ; My sight was ever thick ; regard Titinius , And tell me what thou notest about the field . *stop*
Pindarus ascends the hill . *stop*
This day I breathed first : time is come round , And where I did begin , there shall I end ; My life is run his compass . *stop*
Sirrah , what news ? *stop*
PINDARUS . *stop*
[ Above . ] *stop*
O my lord ! *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
What news ? *stop*
PINDARUS . *stop*
[ Above . ] *stop*
Titinius is enclosed round about With horsemen , that make to him on the spur ; Yet he spurs on . *stop*
Now they are almost on him . *stop*
Now , Titinius ! *stop*
Now some light . *stop*
O , he lights too . *stop*
He 's ta'en [ Shout . ] *stop*
And , hark ! *stop*
They shout for joy . *stop*
CASSIUS . *stop*
Come down ; behold no more . *stop*
O , coward that I am , to live so long , To see my best friend ta'en before my face ! *stop*
Pindarus descends . *stop*
Come hither , sirrah . *stop*
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner , And then I swore thee , saving of thy life , That whatsoever I did bid thee do , Thou shouldst attempt it . *stop*
Come now , keep thine oath ; Now be a freeman , and with this good sword , That ran through Caesar 's bowels , search this bosom . *stop*
Stand not to answer : here , take thou the hilts ; And when my face is cover 'd , as 't is now , Guide thou the sword . *stop*
[ Pindarus stabs him . ] *stop*
Caesar , thou art revenged , Even with the sword that kill 'd thee . *stop*
Dies . *stop*
PINDARUS . *stop*
So , I am free , yet would not so have been , Durst I have done my will . *stop*
O Cassius ! *stop*
Far from this country Pindarus shall run , Where never Roman shall take note of him . *stop*
Exit . *stop*
Re-enter Titinius with Messala . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
It is but change , Titinius , for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus ' power , As Cassius ' legions are by Antony . *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
These tidings would well comfort Cassius . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Where did you leave him ? *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
All disconsolate , With Pindarus his bondman , on this hill . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Is not that he that lies upon the ground ? *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
He lies not like the living . *stop*
O my heart ! *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Is not that he ? *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
No , this was he , Messala , But Cassius is no more . *stop*
O setting sun , As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night , So in his red blood Cassius ' day is set , The sun of Rome is set ! *stop*
Our day is gone ; Clouds , dews , and dangers come ; our deeds are done ! *stop*
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed . *stop*
O hateful error , melancholy 's child , Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not ? *stop*
O error , soon conceived , Thou never comest unto a happy birth , But kill'st the mother that engender 'd thee ! *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
What , Pindarus ! *stop*
Where art thou , Pindarus ? *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Seek him , Titinius , whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus , thrusting this report Into his ears . *stop*
I may say `` thrusting '' it , For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight . *stop*
TITINIUS . *stop*
Hie you , Messala , And I will seek for Pindarus the while . *stop*
Exit Messala . *stop*
Why didst thou send me forth , brave Cassius ? *stop*
Did I not meet thy friends ? *stop*
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory , And bid me give it thee ? *stop*
Didst thou not hear their shouts ? *stop*
Alas , thou hast misconstrued everything ! *stop*
But , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow ; Thy Brutus bid me give it thee , and I Will do his bidding . *stop*
Brutus , come apace , And see how I regarded Caius Cassius . *stop*
By your leave , gods , this is a Roman 's part . *stop*
Come , Cassius ' sword , and find Titinius ' heart . *stop*
Kills himself . *stop*
Alarum . *stop*
Re-enter Messala , with Brutus , young Cato , and others . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Where , where , Messala , doth his body lie ? *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Lo , yonder , and Titinius mourning it . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Titinius ' face is upward . *stop*
CATO . *stop*
He is slain . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
O Julius Caesar , thou art mighty yet ! *stop*
Thy spirit walks abroad , and turns our swords In our own proper entrails . *stop*
Low alarums . *stop*
CATO . *stop*
Brave Titinius ! *stop*
Look whe'er he have not crown 'd dead Cassius ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Are yet two Romans living such as these ? *stop*
The last of all the Romans , fare thee well ! *stop*
It is impossible that ever Rome Should breed thy fellow . *stop*
Friends , I owe moe tears To this dead man than you shall see me pay . *stop*
I shall find time , Cassius , I shall find time . *stop*
Come therefore , and to Thasos send his body ; His funerals shall not be in our camp , Lest it discomfort us . *stop*
Lucilius , come , And come , young Cato ; let us to the field . *stop*
Labio and Flavio , set our battles on . *stop*
'T is three o'clock , and Romans , yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE IV . *stop*
Another part of the field . *stop*
Alarum . *stop*
Enter , fighting , Soldiers of both armies ; then Brutus , young Cato , Lucilius , and others . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Yet , countrymen , O , yet hold up your heads ! *stop*
CATO . *stop*
What bastard doth not ? *stop*
Who will go with me ? *stop*
I will proclaim my name about the field . *stop*
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho ! *stop*
A foe to tyrants , and my country 's friend . *stop*
I am the son of Marcus Cato , ho ! *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus , I ; Brutus , my country 's friend ; know me for Brutus ! *stop*
Exit . *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
O young and noble Cato , art thou down ? *stop*
Why , now thou diest as bravely as Titinius , And mayst be honor 'd , being Cato 's son . *stop*
FIRST SOLDIER . *stop*
Yield , or thou diest . *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
Only I yield to die . *stop*
[ Offers money . ] *stop*
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight : Kill Brutus , and be honor 'd in his death . *stop*
FIRST SOLDIER . *stop*
We must not . *stop*
A noble prisoner ! *stop*
SECOND SOLDIER . *stop*
Room , ho ! *stop*
Tell Antony , Brutus is ta'en . *stop*
FIRST SOLDIER . *stop*
I 'll tell the news . *stop*
Here comes the general . *stop*
Enter Antony . *stop*
Brutus is ta'en , Brutus is ta'en , my lord . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
Where is he ? *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
Safe , Antony , Brutus is safe enough . *stop*
I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus ; The gods defend him from so great a shame ! *stop*
When you do find him , or alive or dead , He will be found like Brutus , like himself . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
This is not Brutus , friend , but , I assure you , A prize no less in worth . *stop*
Keep this man safe , Give him all kindness ; I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies . *stop*
Go on , And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead , And bring us word unto Octavius ' tent How everything is chanced . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
SCENE V. Another part of the field . *stop*
Enter Brutus , Dardanius , Clitus , Strato , and Volumnius . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock . *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
Statilius show 'd the torchlight , but , my lord , He came not back . *stop*
He is or ta'en or slain . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Sit thee down , Clitus . *stop*
Slaying is the word : It is a deed in fashion . *stop*
Hark thee , Clitus . *stop*
Whispers . *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
What , I , my lord ? *stop*
No , not for all the world . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Peace then , no words . *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
I 'll rather kill myself . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Hark thee , Dardanius . *stop*
Whispers . *stop*
DARDANIUS . *stop*
Shall I do such a deed ? *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
O Dardanius ! *stop*
DARDANIUS . *stop*
O Clitus ! *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
What ill request did Brutus make to thee ? *stop*
DARDANIUS . *stop*
To kill him , Clitus . *stop*
Look , he meditates . *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
Now is that noble vessel full of grief , That it runs over even at his eyes . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Come hither , good Volumnius , list a word . *stop*
VOLUMNIUS . *stop*
What says my lord ? *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Why , this , Volumnius : The ghost of Caesar hath appear 'd to me Two several times by night ; at Sardis once , And this last night here in Philippi fields . *stop*
I know my hour is come . *stop*
VOLUMNIUS . *stop*
Not so , my lord . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Nay I am sure it is , Volumnius . *stop*
Thou seest the world , Volumnius , how it goes ; Our enemies have beat us to the pit ; Low alarums . *stop*
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us . *stop*
Good Volumnius , Thou know'st that we two went to school together ; Even for that our love of old , I prithee , Hold thou my sword-hilts , whilst I run on it . *stop*
VOLUMNIUS . *stop*
That 's not an office for a friend , my lord . *stop*
Alarum still . *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
Fly , fly , my lord , there is no tarrying here . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Farewell to you , and you , and you , Volumnius . *stop*
Strato , thou hast been all this while asleep ; Farewell to thee too , Strato . *stop*
Countrymen , My heart doth joy that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me . *stop*
I shall have glory by this losing day , More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto . *stop*
So , fare you well at once , for Brutus ' tongue Hath almost ended his life 's history . *stop*
Night hangs upon mine eyes , my bones would rest That have but labor 'd to attain this hour . *stop*
Alarum . *stop*
Cry within , `` Fly , fly , fly ! '' *stop*
CLITUS . *stop*
Fly , my lord , fly . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Hence ! *stop*
I will follow . *stop*
Exeunt Clitus , Dardanius , and Volumnius . *stop*
I prithee , Strato , stay thou by thy lord . *stop*
Thou art a fellow of a good respect ; Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it . *stop*
Hold then my sword , and turn away thy face , While I do run upon it . *stop*
Wilt thou , Strato ? *stop*
STRATO . *stop*
Give me your hand first . *stop*
Fare you well , my lord . *stop*
BRUTUS . *stop*
Farewell , good Strato . *stop*
Runs on his sword . *stop*
Caesar , now be still ; I kill 'd not thee with half so good a will . *stop*
Dies . *stop*
Alarum . *stop*
Retreat . *stop*
Enter Octavius , Antony , Messala , Lucilius , and the Army . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
What man is that ? *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
My master 's man . *stop*
Strato , where is thy master ? *stop*
STRATO . *stop*
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala : The conquerors can but make a fire of him ; For Brutus only overcame himself , And no man else hath honor by his death . *stop*
LUCILIUS . *stop*
So Brutus should be found . *stop*
I thank thee , Brutus , That thou hast proved Lucilius ' saying true . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
All that served Brutus , I will entertain them . *stop*
Fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ? *stop*
STRATO . *stop*
Ay , if Messala will prefer me to you . *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
Do so , good Messala . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
How died my master , Strato ? *stop*
STRATO . *stop*
I held the sword , and he did run on it . *stop*
MESSALA . *stop*
Octavius , then take him to follow thee That did the latest service to my master . *stop*
ANTONY . *stop*
This was the noblest Roman of them all . *stop*
All the conspirators , save only he , Did that they did in envy of great Caesar ; He only , in a general honest thought And common good to all , made one of them . *stop*
His life was gentle , and the elements So mix 'd in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world , `` This was a man ! '' *stop*
OCTAVIUS . *stop*
According to his virtue let us use him With all respect and rites of burial . *stop*
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie , Most like a soldier , ordered honorably . *stop*
So call the field to rest , and let 's away , To part the glories of this happy day . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
THE END *stop*
