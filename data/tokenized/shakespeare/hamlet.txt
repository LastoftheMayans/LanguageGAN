Nay answer me : Stand & vnfold your selfe Bar . *stop*
Long liue the King Fran . *stop*
Barnardo ? *stop*

He Fran . *stop*
You come most carefully vpon your houre Bar . *stop*
'T is now strook twelue , get thee to bed Francisco Fran . *stop*
For this releefe much thankes : 'T is bitter cold , And I am sicke at heart Barn . *stop*
Haue you had quiet Guard ? *stop*
Fran . *stop*
Not a Mouse stirring Barn . *stop*
Well , goodnight . *stop*
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus , the Riuals of my Watch , bid them make hast . *stop*
Enter Horatio and Marcellus . *stop*
Fran . *stop*
I thinke I heare them . *stop*
Stand : who 's there ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Friends to this ground Mar . *stop*
And Leige-men to the Dane Fran . *stop*
Giue you good night Mar . *stop*
O farwel honest Soldier , who hath relieu 'd you ? *stop*
Fra . *stop*
Barnardo ha 's my place : giue you goodnight . *stop*
Exit Fran . *stop*
Mar . *stop*
Holla Barnardo Bar . *stop*
Say , what is Horatio there ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
A peece of him Bar . *stop*
Welcome Horatio , welcome good Marcellus Mar . *stop*
What , ha 's this thing appear 'd againe to night Bar . *stop*
I haue seene nothing Mar . *stop*
Horatio saies , 't is but our Fantasie , And will not let beleefe take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight , twice seene of vs , Therefore I haue intreated him along With vs , to watch the minutes of this Night , That if againe this Apparition come , He may approue our eyes , and speake to it Hor . *stop*
Tush , tush , 'twill not appeare Bar . *stop*
Sit downe a-while , And let vs once againe assaile your eares , That are so fortified against our Story , What we two Nights haue seene Hor . *stop*
Well , sit we downe , And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this Barn . *stop*
Last night of all , When yond same Starre that 's Westward from the Pole Had made his course t ' illume that part of Heauen Where now it burnes , Marcellus and my selfe , The Bell then beating one Mar . *stop*
Peace , breake thee of : Enter the Ghost . *stop*
Looke where it comes againe Barn . *stop*
In the same figure , like the King that 's dead Mar . *stop*
Thou art a Scholler ; speake to it Horatio Barn . *stop*
Lookes it not like the King ? *stop*
Marke it Horatio Hora . *stop*
Most like : It harrowes me with fear & wonder Barn . *stop*
It would be spoke too Mar . *stop*
Question it Horatio Hor . *stop*
What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night , Together with that Faire and Warlike forme In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke Did sometimes march : By Heauen I charge thee speake Mar . *stop*
It is offended Barn . *stop*
See , it stalkes away Hor . *stop*
Stay : speake ; speake : I Charge thee , speake . *stop*
Exit the Ghost . *stop*
Mar . *stop*
'T is gone , and will not answer Barn . *stop*
How now Horatio ? *stop*
You tremble & look pale : Is not this something more then Fantasie ? *stop*
What thinke you o n't ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Before my God , I might not this beleeue Without the sensible and true auouch Of mine owne eyes Mar . *stop*
Is it not like the King ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
As thou art to thy selfe , Such was the very Armour he had on , When th ' Ambitious Norwey combatted : So frown 'd he once , when in an angry parle He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice . *stop*
'T is strange Mar . *stop*
Thus twice before , and iust at this dead houre , With Martiall stalke , hath he gone by our Watch Hor . *stop*
In what particular thought to work , I know not : But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion , This boades some strange erruption to our State Mar . *stop*
Good now sit downe , & tell me he that knowes Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch , So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land , And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre : Why such impresse of Ship-wrights , whose sore Taske Do 's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke , What might be toward , that this sweaty hast Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day : Who is't that can informe me ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
That can I , At least the whisper goes so : Our last King , Whose Image euen but now appear 'd to vs , Was ( as you know ) by Fortinbras of Norway , ( Thereto prick 'd on by a most emulate Pride ) Dar 'd to the Combate . *stop*
In which , our Valiant Hamlet , ( For so this side of our knowne world esteem 'd him ) Did slay this Fortinbras : who by a Seal 'd Compact , Well ratified by Law , and Heraldrie , Did forfeite ( with his life ) all those his Lands Which he stood seiz 'd on , to the Conqueror : Against the which , a Moity competent Was gaged by our King : which had return'd To the Inheritance of Fortinbras , Had he bin Vanquisher , as by the same Cou'nant And carriage of the Article designe , His fell to Hamlet . *stop*
Now sir , young Fortinbras , Of vnimproued Mettle , hot and full , Hath in the skirts of Norway , heere and there , Shark 'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes , For Foode and Diet , to some Enterprize That hath a stomacke i n't : which is no other ( And it doth well appeare vnto our State ) But to recouer of vs by strong hand And termes Compulsatiue , those foresaid Lands So by his Father lost : and this ( I take it ) Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations , The Sourse of this our Watch , and the cheefe head Of this post-hast , and Romage in the Land . *stop*
Enter Ghost againe . *stop*
But soft , behold : Loe , where it comes againe : Ile crosse it , though it blast me . *stop*
Stay Illusion : If thou hast any sound , or vse of Voyce , Speake to me . *stop*
If there be any good thing to be done , That may to thee do ease , and grace to me ; speak to me . *stop*
If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate ( Which happily foreknowing may auoyd ) Oh speake . *stop*
Or , if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth , ( For which , they say , you Spirits oft walke in death ) Speake of it . *stop*
Stay , and speake . *stop*
Stop it Marcellus Mar . *stop*
Shall I strike at it with my Partizan ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Do , if it will not stand Barn . *stop*
'T is heere Hor . *stop*
'T is heere Mar . *stop*
'T is gone . *stop*
Exit Ghost . *stop*
We do it wrong , being so Maiesticall To offer it the shew of Violence , For it is as the Ayre , invulnerable , And our vaine blowes , malicious Mockery Barn . *stop*
It was about to speake , when the Cocke crew Hor . *stop*
And then it started , like a guilty thing Vpon a fearfull Summons . *stop*
I haue heard , The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day , Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate Awake the God of Day : and at his warning , Whether in Sea , or Fire , in Earth , or Ayre , Th ' extrauagant , and erring Spirit , hyes To his Confine . *stop*
And of the truth heerein , This present Obiect made probation Mar . *stop*
It faded on the crowing of the Cocke . *stop*
Some sayes , that euer 'gainst that Season comes Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated , The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long : And then ( they say ) no Spirit can walke abroad , The nights are wholsome , then no Planets strike , No Faiery talkes , nor Witch hath power to Charme : So hallow 'd , and so gracious is the time Hor . *stop*
So haue I heard , and do in part beleeue it . *stop*
But looke , the Morne in Russet mantle clad , Walkes o 're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill , Breake we our Watch vp , and by my aduice Let vs impart what we haue seene to night Vnto yong Hamlet . *stop*
For vpon my life , This Spirit dumbe to vs , will speake to him : Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needfull in our Loues , fitting our Duty ? *stop*
Mar . *stop*
Let do't I pray , and I this morning know Where we shall finde him most conueniently . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Secunda . *stop*
Enter Claudius King of Denmarke , Gertrude the Queene , Hamlet , Polonius , Laertes , and his Sister Ophelia , Lords Attendant . *stop*
King . *stop*
Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death The memory be greene : and that it vs befitted To beare our hearts in greefe , and our whole Kingdome To be contracted in one brow of woe : Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature , That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him , Together with remembrance of our selues . *stop*
Therefore our sometimes Sister , now our Queene , Th ' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State , Haue we , as 'twere , with a defeated ioy , With one Auspicious , and one Dropping eye , With mirth in Funerall , and with Dirge in Marriage , In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole Taken to Wife ; nor haue we heerein barr'd Your better Wisedomes , which haue freely gone With this affaire along , for all our Thankes . *stop*
Now followes , that you know young Fortinbras , Holding a weake supposall of our worth ; Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death , Our State to be disioynt , and out of Frame , Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage ; He hath not fayl 'd to pester vs with Message , Importing the surrender of those Lands Lost by his Father : with all Bonds of Law To our most valiant Brother . *stop*
So much for him . *stop*
Enter Voltemand and Cornelius . *stop*
Now for our selfe , and for this time of meeting Thus much the businesse is . *stop*
We haue heere writ To Norway , Vncle of young Fortinbras , Who Impotent and Bedrid , scarsely heares Of this his Nephewes purpose , to suppresse His further gate heerein . *stop*
In that the Leuies , The Lists , and full proportions are all made Out of his subiect : and we heere dispatch You good Cornelius , and you Voltemand , For bearing of this greeting to old Norway , Giuing to you no further personall power To businesse with the King , more then the scope Of these dilated Articles allow : Farewell , and let your hast commend your duty Volt . *stop*
In that , and all things , will we shew our duty King . *stop*
We doubt it nothing , heartily farewell . *stop*
Exit Voltemand and Cornelius . *stop*
And now Laertes , what 's the newes with you ? *stop*
You told vs of some suite . *stop*
What is't Laertes ? *stop*
You can not speake of Reason to the Dane , And loose your voyce . *stop*
What would'st thou beg Laertes , That shall not be my Offer , not thy Asking ? *stop*
The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart , The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth , Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father . *stop*
What would'st thou haue Laertes ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
Dread my Lord , Your leaue and fauour to returne to France , From whence , though willingly I came to Denmarke To shew my duty in your Coronation , Yet now I must confesse , that duty done , My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France , And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon King . *stop*
Haue you your Fathers leaue ? *stop*
What sayes Pollonius ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
He hath my Lord : I do beseech you giue him leaue to go King . *stop*
Take thy faire houre Laertes , time be thine , And thy best graces spend it at thy will : But now my Cosin Hamlet , and my Sonne ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
A little more then kin , and lesse then kinde King . *stop*
How is it that the Clouds still hang on you ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Not so my Lord , I am too much i'th ' Sun Queen . *stop*
Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off , And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke . *stop*
Do not for euer with thy veyled lids Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust ; Thou know'st 't is common , all that liues must dye , Passing through Nature , to Eternity Ham . *stop*
I Madam , it is common Queen . *stop*
If it be ; Why seemes it so particular with thee Ham . *stop*
Seemes Madam ? *stop*
Nay , it is : I know not Seemes : 'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake ( good Mother ) Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke , Nor windy suspiration of forc 'd breath , No , nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye , Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage , Together with all Formes , Moods , shewes of Griefe , That can denote me truly . *stop*
These indeed Seeme , For they are actions that a man might play : But I haue that Within , which passeth show ; These , but the Trappings , and the Suites of woe King . *stop*
'T is sweet and commendable In your Nature Hamlet , To giue these mourning duties to your Father : But you must know , your Father lost a Father , That Father lost , lost his , and the Suruiuer bound In filiall Obligation , for some terme To do obsequious Sorrow . *stop*
But to perseuer In obstinate Condolement , is a course Of impious stubbornnesse . *stop*
'T is vnmanly greefe , It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen , A Heart vnfortified , a Minde impatient , An Vnderstanding simple , and vnschool 'd : For , what we know must be , and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sence , Why should we in our peeuish Opposition Take it to heart ? *stop*
Fye , 't is a fault to Heauen , A fault against the Dead , a fault to Nature , To Reason most absurd , whose common Theame Is death of Fathers , and who still hath cried , From the first Coarse , till he that dyed to day , This must be so . *stop*
We pray you throw to earth This vnpreuayling woe , and thinke of vs As of a Father ; For let the world take note , You are the most immediate to our Throne , And with no lesse Nobility of Loue , Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne , Do I impart towards you . *stop*
For your intent In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg , It is most retrograde to our desire : And we beseech you , bend you to remaine Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye , Our cheefest Courtier Cosin , and our Sonne Qu . *stop*
Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet : I prythee stay with vs , go not to Wittenberg Ham . *stop*
I shall in all my best Obey you Madam King . *stop*
Why 't is a louing , and a faire Reply , Be as our selfe in Denmarke . *stop*
Madam come , This gentle and vnforc 'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart ; in grace whereof , No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day , But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell , And the Kings Rouce , the Heauens shall bruite againe , Respeaking earthly Thunder . *stop*
Come away . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Manet Hamlet . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Oh that this too too solid Flesh , would melt , Thaw , and resolue it selfe into a Dew : Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter . *stop*
O God , O God ! *stop*
How weary , stale , flat , and vnprofitable Seemes to me all the vses of this world ? *stop*
Fie o n't ? *stop*
Oh fie , fie , 't is an vnweeded Garden That growes to Seed : Things rank , and grosse in Nature Possesse it meerely . *stop*
That it should come to this : But two months dead : Nay , not so much ; not two , So excellent a King , that was to this Hiperion to a Satyre : so louing to my Mother , That he might not beteene the windes of heauen Visit her face too roughly . *stop*
Heauen and Earth Must I remember : why she would hang on him , As if encrease of Appetite had growne By what is fed on ; and yet within a month ? *stop*
Let me not thinke o n't : Frailty , thy name is woman . *stop*
A little Month , or ere those shooes were old , With which she followed my poore Fathers body Like Niobe , all teares . *stop*
Why she , euen she . *stop*
( O Heauen ! *stop*
A beast that wants discourse of Reason Would haue mourn 'd longer ) married with mine Vnkle , My Fathers Brother : but no more like my Father , Then I to Hercules . *stop*
Within a Moneth ? *stop*
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes , She married . *stop*
O most wicked speed , to post With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets : It is not , nor it can not come to good . *stop*
But breake my heart , for I must hold my tongue . *stop*
Enter Horatio , Barnardo , and Marcellus . *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Haile to your Lordship Ham . *stop*
I am glad to see you well : Horatio , or I do forget my selfe Hor . *stop*
The same my Lord , And your poore Seruant euer Ham . *stop*
Sir my good friend , Ile change that name with you : And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio ? *stop*
Marcellus Mar . *stop*
My good Lord Ham . *stop*
I am very glad to see you : good euen Sir . *stop*
But what in faith make you from Wittemberge ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
A truant disposition , good my Lord Ham . *stop*
I would not haue your Enemy say so ; Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence , To make it truster of your owne report Against your selfe . *stop*
I know you are no Truant : But what is your affaire in Elsenour ? *stop*
Wee ' l teach you to drinke deepe , ere you depart Hor . *stop*
My Lord , I came to see your Fathers Funerall Ham . *stop*
I pray thee doe not mock me ( fellow Student ) I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding Hor . *stop*
Indeed my Lord , it followed hard vpon Ham . *stop*
Thrift thrift Horatio : the Funerall Bakt-meats Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables ; Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen , Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio . *stop*
My father , me thinkes I see my father Hor . *stop*
Oh where my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
In my minds eye ( Horatio ) Hor . *stop*
I saw him once ; he was a goodly King Ham . *stop*
He was a man , take him for all in all : I shall not look vpon his like againe Hor . *stop*
My Lord , I thinke I saw him yesternight Ham . *stop*
Saw ? *stop*
Who ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
My Lord , the King your Father Ham . *stop*
The King my Father ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Season your admiration for a while With an attent eare ; till I may deliuer Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen , This maruell to you Ham . *stop*
For Heauens loue let me heare Hor . *stop*
Two nights together , had these Gentlemen ( Marcellus and Barnardo ) on their Watch In the dead wast and middle of the night Beene thus encountred . *stop*
A figure like your Father , Arm 'd at all points exactly , Cap a Pe , Appeares before them , and with sollemne march Goes slow and stately : By them thrice he walkt , By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes , Within his Truncheons length ; whilst they bestil'd Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare , Stand dumbe and speake not to him . *stop*
This to me In dreadfull secrecie impart they did , And I with them the third Night kept the Watch , Whereas they had deliuer 'd both in time , Forme of the thing ; each word made true and good , The Apparition comes . *stop*
I knew your Father : These hands are not more like Ham . *stop*
But where was this ? *stop*
Mar . *stop*
My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht Ham . *stop*
Did you not speake to it ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
My Lord , I did ; But answere made it none : yet once me thought It lifted vp it head , and did addresse It selfe to motion , like as it would speake : But euen then , the Morning Cocke crew lowd ; And at the sound it shrunke in hast away , And vanisht from our sight Ham . *stop*
Tis very strange Hor . *stop*
As I doe liue my honourd Lord 't is true ; And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty To let you know of it Ham . *stop*
Indeed , indeed Sirs ; but this troubles me . *stop*
Hold you the watch to Night ? *stop*
Both . *stop*
We doe my Lord Ham . *stop*
Arm 'd , say you ? *stop*
Both . *stop*
Arm 'd , my Lord Ham . *stop*
From top to toe ? *stop*
Both . *stop*
My Lord , from head to foote Ham . *stop*
Then saw you not his face ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
O yes , my Lord , he wore his Beauer vp Ham . *stop*
What , lookt he frowningly ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
A countenance more in sorrow then in anger Ham . *stop*
Pale , or red ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Nay very pale Ham . *stop*
And fixt his eyes vpon you ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Most constantly Ham . *stop*
I would I had beene there Hor . *stop*
It would haue much amaz 'd you Ham . *stop*
Very like , very like : staid it long ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred All . *stop*
Longer , longer Hor . *stop*
Not when I saw't Ham . *stop*
His Beard was grisly ? *stop*
no Hor . *stop*
It was , as I haue seene it in his life , A Sable Siluer'd Ham . *stop*
Ile watch to Night ; perchance 'twill wake againe Hor . *stop*
I warrant you it will Ham . *stop*
If it assume my noble Fathers person , Ile speake to it , though Hell it selfe should gape And bid me hold my peace . *stop*
I pray you all , If you haue hitherto conceald this sight ; Let it bee treble in your silence still : And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night , Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue ; I will requite your loues ; so fare ye well : Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue , Ile visit you All . *stop*
Our duty to your Honour . *stop*
Exeunt Ham . *stop*
Your loue , as mine to you : farewell . *stop*
My Fathers Spirit in Armes ? *stop*
All is not well : I doubt some foule play : would the Night were come ; Till then sit still my soule ; foule deeds will rise , Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Scena Tertia Enter Laertes and Ophelia . *stop*
Laer . *stop*
My necessaries are imbark't ; Farewell : And Sister , as the Winds giue Benefit , And Conuoy is assistant ; doe not sleepe , But let me heare from you Ophel . *stop*
Doe you doubt that ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
For Hamlet , and the trifling of his fauours , Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude ; A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature ; Froward , not permanent ; sweet not lasting The suppliance of a minute ? *stop*
No more Ophel . *stop*
No more but so Laer . *stop*
Thinke it no more : For nature cressant does not grow alone , In thewes and Bulke : but as his Temple waxes , The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule Growes wide withall . *stop*
Perhaps he loues you now , And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch The vertue of his feare : but you must feare His greatnesse weigh 'd , his will is not his owne ; For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth : Hee may not , as vnuallued persons doe , Carue for himselfe ; for , on his choyce depends The sanctity and health of the whole State . *stop*
And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body , Whereof he is the Head . *stop*
Then if he sayes he loues you , It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it ; As he in his peculiar Sect and force May giue his saying deed : which is no further , Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall . *stop*
Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine , If with too credent eare you list his Songs ; Or lose your Heart ; or your chast Treasure open To his vnmastred importunity . *stop*
Feare it Ophelia , feare it my deare Sister , And keepe within the reare of your Affection ; Out of the shot and danger of Desire . *stop*
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough , If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone : Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes , The Canker Galls , the Infants of the Spring Too oft before the buttons be disclos 'd , And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent . *stop*
Be wary then , best safety lies in feare ; Youth to it selfe rebels , though none else neere Ophe . *stop*
I shall th ' effect of this good Lesson keepe , As watchmen to my heart : but good my Brother Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe , Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen ; Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine Himselfe , the Primrose path of dalliance treads , And reaks not his owne reade Laer . *stop*
Oh , feare me not . *stop*
Enter Polonius . *stop*
I stay too long ; but here my Father comes : A double blessing is a double grace ; Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue Polon . *stop*
Yet heere Laertes ? *stop*
Aboord , aboord for shame , The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile , And you are staid for there : my blessing with you ; And these few Precepts in thy memory , See thou Character . *stop*
Giue thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any vnproportion 'd thoughts his Act : Be thou familiar ; but by no meanes vulgar : The friends thou hast , and their adoption tride , Grapple them to thy Soule , with hoopes of Steele : But doe not dull thy palme , with entertainment Of each vnhatch't , vnfledg 'd Comrade . *stop*
Beware Of entrance to a quarrell : but being in Bear't that th ' opposed may beware of thee . *stop*
Giue euery man thine eare ; but few thy voyce : Take each mans censure ; but reserue thy iudgement : Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy ; But not exprest in fancie ; rich , not gawdie : For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man . *stop*
And they in France of the best ranck and station , Are of a most select and generous cheff in that . *stop*
Neither a borrower , nor a lender be ; For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend : And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry . *stop*
This aboue all ; to thine owne selfe be true : And it must follow , as the Night the Day , Thou canst not then be false to any man . *stop*
Farewell : my Blessing season this in thee Laer . *stop*
Most humbly doe I take my leaue , my Lord Polon . *stop*
The time inuites you , goe , your seruants tend Laer . *stop*
Farewell Ophelia , and remember well What I haue said to you Ophe . *stop*
Tis in my memory lockt , And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it Laer . *stop*
Farewell . *stop*
Exit Laer . *stop*
Polon . *stop*
What ist Ophelia he hath said to you ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
So please you , somthing touching the L [ ord ] . *stop*
Hamlet Polon . *stop*
Marry , well bethought : Tis told me he hath very oft of late Giuen priuate time to you ; and you your selfe Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous . *stop*
If it be so , as so tis put on me ; And that in way of caution : I must tell you , You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely , As it behoues my Daughter , and your Honour . *stop*
What is betweene you , giue me vp the truth ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
He hath my Lord of late , made many tenders Of his affection to me Polon . *stop*
Affection , puh . *stop*
You speake like a greene Girle , Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance . *stop*
Doe you beleeue his tenders , as you call them ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
I do not know , my Lord , what I should thinke Polon . *stop*
Marry Ile teach you ; thinke your selfe a Baby , That you haue tane his tenders for true pay , Which are not starling . *stop*
Tender your selfe more dearly ; Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase , Roaming it thus , you ' l tender me a foole Ophe . *stop*
My Lord , he hath importun 'd me with loue , In honourable fashion Polon . *stop*
I , fashion you may call it , go too , go too Ophe . *stop*
And hath giuen countenance to his speech , My Lord , with all the vowes of Heauen Polon . *stop*
I , Springes to catch Woodcocks . *stop*
I doe know When the Bloud burnes , how Prodigall the Soule Giues the tongue vowes : these blazes , Daughter , Giuing more light then heate ; extinct in both , Euen in their promise , as it is a making ; You must not take for fire . *stop*
For this time Daughter , Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence ; Set your entreatments at a higher rate , Then a command to parley . *stop*
For Lord Hamlet , Beleeue so much in him , that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walke , Then may be giuen you . *stop*
In few , Ophelia , Doe not beleeue his vowes ; for they are Broakers , Not of the eye , which their Inuestments show : But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes , Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds , The better to beguile . *stop*
This is for all : I would not , in plaine tearmes , from this time forth , Haue you so slander any moment leisure , As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet : Looke too't , I charge you ; come your wayes Ophe . *stop*
I shall obey my Lord . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter Hamlet , Horatio , Marcellus . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
The Ayre bites shrewdly : is it very cold ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
It is a nipping and an eager ayre Ham . *stop*
What hower now ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
I thinke it lacks of twelue Mar . *stop*
No , it is strooke Hor . *stop*
Indeed I heard it not : then it drawes neere the season , Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke . *stop*
What does this meane my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
The King doth wake to night , and takes his rouse , Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles , And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe , The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his Pledge Horat . *stop*
Is it a custome ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I marry ist ; And to my mind , though I am natiue heere , And to the manner borne : It is a Custome More honour 'd in the breach , then the obseruance . *stop*
Enter Ghost . *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Looke my Lord , it comes Ham . *stop*
Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs : Be thou a Spirit of health , or Goblin damn 'd , Bring with thee ayres from Heauen , or blasts from Hell , Be thy euents wicked or charitable , Thou com'st in such a questionable shape That I will speake to thee . *stop*
Ile call thee Hamlet , King , Father , Royall Dane : Oh , oh , answer me , Let me not burst in Ignorance ; but tell Why thy Canoniz 'd bones Hearsed in death , Haue burst their cerments , why the Sepulcher Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn 'd , Hath op 'd his ponderous and Marble iawes , To cast thee vp againe ? *stop*
What may this meane ? *stop*
That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele , Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone , Making Night hidious ? *stop*
And we fooles of Nature , So horridly to shake our disposition , With thoughts beyond thee ; reaches of our Soules , Say , why is this ? *stop*
wherefore ? *stop*
what should we doe ? *stop*
Ghost beckens Hamlet . *stop*
Hor . *stop*
It beckons you to goe away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone Mar . *stop*
Looke with what courteous action It wafts you to a more remoued ground : But doe not goe with it Hor . *stop*
No , by no meanes Ham . *stop*
It will not speake : then will I follow it Hor . *stop*
Doe not my Lord Ham . *stop*
Why , what should be the feare ? *stop*
I doe not set my life at a pins fee ; And for my Soule , what can it doe to that ? *stop*
Being a thing immortall as it selfe : It waues me forth againe ; Ile follow it Hor . *stop*
What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord ? *stop*
Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe , That beetles o 're his base into the Sea , And there assumes some other horrible forme , Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason , And draw you into madnesse thinke of it ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
It wafts me still : goe on , Ile follow thee Mar . *stop*
You shall not goe my Lord Ham . *stop*
Hold off your hand Hor . *stop*
Be rul 'd , you shall not goe Ham . *stop*
My fate cries out , And makes each petty Artire in this body , As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue : Still am I cal 'd ? *stop*
Vnhand me Gentlemen : By Heau ' n , Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me : I say away , goe on , Ile follow thee . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Ghost & Hamlet . *stop*
Hor . *stop*
He waxes desperate with imagination Mar . *stop*
Let 's follow ; 't is not fit thus to obey him Hor . *stop*
Haue after , to what issue will this come ? *stop*
Mar . *stop*
Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke Hor . *stop*
Heauen will direct it Mar . *stop*
Nay , let 's follow him . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter Ghost and Hamlet . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Where wilt thou lead me ? *stop*
speak ; Ile go no further Gho . *stop*
Marke me Ham . *stop*
I will Gho . *stop*
My hower is almost come , When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames Must render vp my selfe Ham . *stop*
Alas poore Ghost Gho . *stop*
Pitty me not , but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall vnfold Ham . *stop*
Speake , I am bound to heare Gho . *stop*
So art thou to reuenge , when thou shalt heare Ham . *stop*
What ? *stop*
Gho . *stop*
I am thy Fathers Spirit , Doom 'd for a certaine terme to walke the night ; And for the day confin 'd to fast in Fiers , Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature Are burnt and purg 'd away ? *stop*
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my Prison-House ; I could a Tale vnfold , whose lightest word Would harrow vp thy soule , freeze thy young blood , Make thy two eyes like Starres , start from their Spheres , Thy knotty and combined lockes to part , And each particular haire to stand an end , Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine : But this eternall blason must not be To eares of flesh and bloud ; list Hamlet , oh list , If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue Ham . *stop*
Oh Heauen ! *stop*
Gho . *stop*
Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther Ham . *stop*
Murther ? *stop*
Ghost . *stop*
Murther most foule , as in the best it is ; But this most foule , strange , and vnnaturall Ham . *stop*
Hast , hast me to know it , That with wings as swift As meditation , or the thoughts of Loue , May sweepe to my Reuenge Ghost . *stop*
I finde thee apt , And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede That rots it selfe in ease , on Lethe Wharfe , Would'st thou not stirre in this . *stop*
Now Hamlet heare : It 's giuen out , that sleeping in mine Orchard , A Serpent stung me : so the whole eare of Denmarke , Is by a forged processe of my death Rankly abus 'd : But know thou Noble youth , The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life , Now weares his Crowne Ham . *stop*
O my Propheticke soule : mine Vncle ? *stop*
Ghost . *stop*
I that incestuous , that adulterate Beast With witchcraft of his wits , hath Traitorous guifts . *stop*
Oh wicked Wit , and Gifts , that haue the power So to seduce ? *stop*
Won to this shamefull Lust The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene : Oh Hamlet , what a falling off was there , From me , whose loue was of that dignity , That it went hand in hand , euen with the Vow I made to her in Marriage ; and to decline Vpon a wretch , whose Naturall gifts were poore To those of mine . *stop*
But Vertue , as it neuer wil be moued , Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen : So Lust , though to a radiant Angell link 'd , Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed , & prey on Garbage . *stop*
But soft , me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre ; Briefe let me be : Sleeping within mine Orchard , My custome alwayes in the afternoone ; Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl , And in the Porches of mine eares did poure The leaperous Distilment ; whose effect Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man , That swift as Quick-siluer , it courses through The naturall Gates and Allies of the body ; And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset And curd , like Aygre droppings into Milke , The thin and wholsome blood : so did it mine ; And a most instant Tetter bak 'd about , Most Lazar-like , with vile and loathsome crust , All my smooth Body . *stop*
Thus was I , sleeping , by a Brothers hand , Of Life , of Crowne , and Queene at once dispatcht ; Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne , Vnhouzzled , disappointed , vnnaneld , No reckoning made , but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head ; Oh horrible Oh horrible , most horrible : If thou hast nature in thee beare it not ; Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest . *stop*
But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act , Taint not thy mind ; nor let thy Soule contriue Against thy Mother ought ; leaue her to heauen , And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge , To pricke and sting her . *stop*
Fare thee well at once ; The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere , And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire : Adue , adue , Hamlet : remember me . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Oh all you host of Heauen ! *stop*
Oh Earth ; what els ? *stop*
And shall I couple Hell ? *stop*
Oh fie : hold my heart ; And you my sinnewes , grow not instant Old ; But beare me stiffely vp : Remember thee ? *stop*
I , thou poore Ghost , while memory holds a seate In this distracted Globe : Remember thee ? *stop*
Yea , from the Table of my Memory , Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records , All sawes of Bookes , all formes , all presures past , That youth and obseruation coppied there ; And thy Commandment all alone shall liue Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine , Vnmixt with baser matter ; yes yes , by Heauen : Oh most pernicious woman ! *stop*
Oh Villaine , Villaine , smiling damned Villaine ! *stop*
My Tables , my Tables ; meet it is I set it downe , That one may smile , and smile and be a Villaine ; At least I 'm sure it may be so in Denmarke ; So Vnckle there you are : now to my word ; It is ; Adue , Adue , Remember me : I haue sworn't Hor . *stop*
& Mar . *stop*

My Lord , my Lord . *stop*
Enter Horatio and Marcellus . *stop*

Lord Hamlet Hor . *stop*
Heauen secure him Mar . *stop*
So be it Hor . *stop*
Illo , ho , ho , my Lord Ham . *stop*
Hillo , ho , ho , boy ; come bird , come Mar . *stop*
How ist my Noble Lord ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
What newes , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Oh wonderfull ! *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Good my Lord tell it Ham . *stop*
No you ' l reueale it Hor . *stop*
Not I , my Lord , by Heauen Mar . *stop*
Nor I , my Lord Ham . *stop*
How say you then , would heart of man once think it ? *stop*
But you ' l be secret ? *stop*
Both . *stop*
I , by Heau ' n , my Lord Ham . *stop*
There 's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke But hee 's an arrant knaue Hor . *stop*
There needs no Ghost my Lord , come from the Graue , to tell vs this Ham . *stop*
Why right , you are i'th ' right ; And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands , and part : You , as your busines and desires shall point you : For euery man ha 's businesse and desire , Such as it is : and for mine owne poore part , Looke you , Ile goe pray Hor . *stop*
These are but wild and hurling words , my Lord Ham . *stop*
I 'm sorry they offend you heartily : Yes faith , heartily Hor . *stop*
There 's no offence my Lord Ham . *stop*
Yes , by Saint Patricke , but there is my Lord , And much offence too , touching this Vision heere : It is an honest Ghost , that let me tell you : For your desire to know what is betweene vs , O'remaster't as you may . *stop*
And now good friends , As you are Friends , Schollers and Soldiers , Giue me one poore request Hor . *stop*
What is't my Lord ? *stop*
we will Ham . *stop*
Neuer make known what you haue seen to night Both . *stop*
My Lord , we will not Ham . *stop*
Nay , but swear't Hor . *stop*
Infaith my Lord , not I Mar . *stop*
Nor I my Lord : in faith Ham . *stop*
Vpon my sword Marcell . *stop*
We haue sworne my Lord already Ham . *stop*
Indeed , vpon my sword , Indeed Gho . *stop*
Sweare . *stop*
Ghost cries vnder the Stage . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Ah ha boy , sayest thou so . *stop*
Art thou there truepenny ? *stop*
Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge Consent to sweare Hor . *stop*
Propose the Oath my Lord Ham . *stop*
Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene . *stop*
Sweare by my sword Gho . *stop*
Sweare Ham . *stop*
Hic & vbique ? *stop*
Then wee ' l shift for grownd , Come hither Gentlemen , And lay your hands againe vpon my sword , Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard : Sweare by my Sword Gho . *stop*
Sweare Ham . *stop*
Well said old Mole , can'st worke i'th ' ground so fast ? *stop*
A worthy Pioner , once more remoue good friends Hor . *stop*
Oh day and night : but this is wondrous strange Ham . *stop*
And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome . *stop*
There are more things in Heauen and Earth , Horatio , Then are dream't of in our Philosophy . *stop*
But come , Here as before , neuer so helpe you mercy , How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe ; ( As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet To put an Anticke disposition on : ) That you at such time seeing me , neuer shall With Armes encombred thus , or thus , head shake ; Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase ; As well , we know , or we could and if we would , Or if we list to speake ; or there be and if there might , Or such ambiguous giuing out to note , That you know ought of me ; this not to doe : So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you : Sweare Ghost . *stop*
Sweare Ham . *stop*
Rest , rest perturbed Spirit : so Gentlemen , With all my loue I doe commend me to you ; And what so poore a man as Hamlet is , May doe t ' expresse his loue and friending to you , God willing shall not lacke : let vs goe in together , And still your fingers on your lippes I pray , The time is out of ioynt : Oh cursed spight , That euer I was borne to set it right . *stop*
Nay , come let 's goe together . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Actus Secundus . *stop*
Enter Polonius , and Reynoldo . *stop*
Polon . *stop*
Giue him his money , and these notes Reynoldo Reynol . *stop*
I will my Lord Polon . *stop*
You shall doe maruels wisely : good Reynoldo , Before you visite him you make inquiry Of his behauiour Reynol . *stop*
My Lord , I did intend it Polon . *stop*
Marry , well said ; Very well said . *stop*
Looke you Sir , Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris ; And how , and who ; what meanes ; and where they keepe : What company , at what expence : and finding By this encompassement and drift of question , That they doe know my sonne : Come you more neerer Then your particular demands will touch it , Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him , And thus I know his father and his friends , And in part him . *stop*
Doe you marke this Reynoldo ? *stop*
Reynol . *stop*
I , very well my Lord Polon . *stop*
And in part him , but you may say not well ; But if't be hee I meane , hees very wilde ; Addicted so and so ; and there put on him What forgeries you please ; marry , none so ranke , As may dishonour him ; take heed of that : But Sir , such wanton , wild , and vsuall slips , As are Companions noted and most knowne To youth and liberty Reynol . *stop*
As gaming my Lord Polon . *stop*
I , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarelling , drabbing . *stop*
You may goe so farre Reynol . *stop*
My Lord that would dishonour him Polon . *stop*
Faith no , as you may season it in the charge ; You must not put another scandall on him , That hee is open to Incontinencie ; That 's not my meaning : but breath his faults so quaintly , That they may seeme the taints of liberty ; The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde , A sauagenes in vnreclaim 'd bloud of generall assault Reynol . *stop*
But my good Lord Polon . *stop*
Wherefore should you doe this ? *stop*
Reynol . *stop*
I my Lord , I would know that Polon . *stop*
Marry Sir , heere 's my drift , And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant : You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne , As 'twere a thing a little soil 'd i'th ' working : Marke you your party in conuerse ; him you would sound , Hauing euer seene . *stop*
In the prenominate crimes , The youth you breath of guilty , be assur'd He closes with you in this consequence : Good sir , or so , or friend , or Gentleman . *stop*
According to the Phrase and the Addition , Of man and Country Reynol . *stop*
Very good my Lord Polon . *stop*
And then Sir does he this ? *stop*
He does : what was I about to say ? *stop*
I was about say somthing : where did I leaue ? *stop*
Reynol . *stop*
At closes in the consequence : At friend , or so , and Gentleman Polon . *stop*
At closes in the consequence , I marry , He closes with you thus . *stop*
I know the Gentleman , I saw him yesterday , or tother day ; Or then or then , with such and such ; and as you say , There was he gaming , there o'retooke in 's Rouse , There falling out at Tennis ; or perchance , I saw him enter such a house of saile ; Videlicet , a Brothell , or so forth . *stop*
See you now ; Your bait of falshood , takes this Cape of truth ; And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach With windlesses , and with assaies of Bias , By indirections finde directions out : So by my former Lecture and aduice Shall you my Sonne ; you haue me , haue you not ? *stop*
Reynol . *stop*
My Lord I haue Polon . *stop*
God buy you ; fare you well Reynol . *stop*
Good my Lord Polon . *stop*
Obserue his inclination in your selfe Reynol . *stop*
I shall my Lord Polon . *stop*
And let him plye his Musicke Reynol . *stop*
Well , my Lord . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Enter Ophelia . *stop*
Polon . *stop*
Farewell : How now Ophelia , what 's the matter ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
Alas my Lord , I haue beene so affrighted Polon . *stop*
With what , in the name of Heauen ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
My Lord , as I was sowing in my Chamber , Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac 'd , No hat vpon his head , his stockings foul 'd , Vngartred , and downe giued to his Anckle , Pale as his shirt , his knees knocking each other , And with a looke so pitious in purport , As if he had been loosed out of hell , To speake of horrors : he comes before me Polon . *stop*
Mad for thy Loue ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
My Lord , I doe not know : but truly I do feare it Polon . *stop*
What said he ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
He tooke me by the wrist , and held me hard ; Then goes he to the length of all his arme ; And with his other hand thus o 're his brow , He fals to such perusall of my face , As he would draw it . *stop*
Long staid he so , At last , a little shaking of mine Arme : And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe ; He rais 'd a sigh , so pittious and profound , That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke , And end his being . *stop*
That done , he lets me goe , And with his head ouer his shoulders turn 'd , He seem 'd to finde his way without his eyes , For out adores he went without their helpe ; And to the last , bended their light on me Polon . *stop*
Goe with me , I will goe seeke the King , This is the very extasie of Loue , Whose violent property foredoes it selfe , And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings , As oft as any passion vnder Heauen , That does afflict our Natures . *stop*
I am sorrie , What haue you giuen him any hard words of late ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
No my good Lord : but as you did command , I did repell his Letters , and deny'de His accesse to me Pol . *stop*
That hath made him mad . *stop*
I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement I had not quoted him . *stop*
I feare he did but trifle , And meant to wracke thee : but beshrew my iealousie : It seemes it is as proper to our Age , To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions , As it is common for the yonger sort To lacke discretion . *stop*
Come , go we to the King , This must be knowne , being kept close might moue More greefe to hide , then hate to vtter loue . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Scena Secunda . *stop*
Enter King , Queene , Rosincrane , and Guildensterne Cum alijs . *stop*
King . *stop*
Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne . *stop*
Moreouer , that we much did long to see you , The neede we haue to vse you , did prouoke Our hastie sending . *stop*
Something haue you heard Of Hamlets transformation : so I call it , Since not th ' exterior , nor the inward man Resembles that it was . *stop*
What it should bee More then his Fathers death , that thus hath put him So much from th ' vnderstanding of himselfe , I can not deeme of . *stop*
I intreat you both , That being of so young dayes brought vp with him : And since so Neighbour 'd to his youth , and humour , That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court Some little time : so by your Companies To draw him on to pleasures , and to gather So much as from Occasions you may gleane , That open 'd lies within our remedie Qu . *stop*
Good Gentlemen , he hath much talk 'd of you , And sure I am , two men there are not liuing , To whom he more adheres . *stop*
If it will please you To shew vs so much Gentrie , and good will , As to expend your time with vs a-while , For the supply and profit of our Hope , Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes As fits a Kings remembrance Rosin . *stop*
Both your Maiesties Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs , Put your dread pleasures , more into Command Then to Entreatie Guil . *stop*
We both obey , And here giue vp our selues , in the full bent , To lay our Seruices freely at your feete , To be commanded King . *stop*
Thankes Rosincrance , and gentle Guildensterne Qu . *stop*
Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance . *stop*
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed Sonne . *stop*
Go some of ye , And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is Guil . *stop*
Heauens make our presence and our practises Pleasant and helpfull to him . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Queene . *stop*
Amen . *stop*
Enter Polonius . *stop*
Pol . *stop*
Th ' Ambassadors from Norwey , my good Lord , Are ioyfully return'd King . *stop*
Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes Pol . *stop*
Haue I , my Lord ? *stop*
Assure you , my good Liege , I hold my dutie , as I hold my Soule , Both to my God , one to my gracious King : And I do thinke , or else this braine of mine Hunts not the traile of Policie , so sure As I haue vs 'd to do : that I haue found The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie King . *stop*
Oh speake of that , that I do long to heare Pol . *stop*
Giue first admittance to th ' Ambassadors , My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast King . *stop*
Thy selfe do grace to them , and bring them in . *stop*
He tels me my sweet Queene , that he hath found The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper Qu . *stop*
I doubt it is no other , but the maine , His Fathers death , and our o're-hasty Marriage . *stop*
Enter Polonius , Voltumand , and Cornelius . *stop*
King . *stop*
Well , we shall sift him . *stop*
Welcome good Frends : Say Voltumand , what from our Brother Norwey ? *stop*
Volt . *stop*
Most faire returne of Greetings , and Desires . *stop*
Vpon our first , he sent out to suppresse His Nephewes Leuies , which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak : But better look 'd into , he truly found It was against your Highnesse , whereat greeued , That so his Sicknesse , Age , and Impotence Was falsely borne in hand , sends out Arrests On Fortinbras , which he ( in breefe ) obeyes , Receiues rebuke from Norwey : and in fine , Makes Vow before his Vnkle , neuer more To giue th ' assay of Armes against your Maiestie . *stop*
Whereon old Norwey , ouercome with ioy , Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee , And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers So leuied as before , against the Poleak : With an intreaty heerein further shewne , That it might please you to giue quiet passe Through your Dominions , for his Enterprize , On such regards of safety and allowance , As therein are set downe King . *stop*
It likes vs well : And at our more consider 'd time wee ' l read , Answer , and thinke vpon this Businesse . *stop*
Meane time we thanke you , for your well-tooke Labour . *stop*
Go to your rest , at night wee ' l Feast together . *stop*
Most welcome home . *stop*
Exit Ambass . *stop*
Pol . *stop*
This businesse is very well ended . *stop*
My Liege , and Madam , to expostulate What Maiestie should be , what Dutie is , Why day is day ; night , night ; and time is time , Were nothing but to waste Night , Day , and Time . *stop*
Therefore , since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit , And tediousnesse , the limbes and outward flourishes , I will be breefe . *stop*
Your Noble Sonne is mad : Mad call I it ; for to define true Madnesse , What is't , but to be nothing else but mad . *stop*
But let that go Qu . *stop*
More matter , with lesse Art Pol . *stop*
Madam , I sweare I vse no Art at all : That he is mad , 't is true : 'T is true 't is pittie , And pittie it is true : A foolish figure , But farewell it : for I will vse no Art . *stop*
Mad let vs grant him then : and now remaines That we finde out the cause of this effect , Or rather say , the cause of this defect ; For this effect defectiue , comes by cause , Thus it remaines , and the remainder thus . *stop*
Perpend , I haue a daughter : haue , whil'st she is mine , Who in her Dutie and Obedience , marke , Hath giuen me this : now gather , and surmise . *stop*
The Letter . *stop*
To the Celestiall , and my Soules Idoll , the most beautifed Ophelia . *stop*
That 's an ill Phrase , a vilde Phrase , beautified is a vilde Phrase : but you shall heare these in her excellent white bosome , these Qu . *stop*
Came this from Hamlet to her Pol . *stop*
Good Madam stay awhile , I will be faithfull . *stop*
Doubt thou , the Starres are fire , Doubt , that the Sunne doth moue : Doubt Truth to be a Lier , But neuer Doubt , I loue . *stop*
O deere Ophelia , I am ill at these Numbers : I haue not Art to reckon my grones ; but that I loue thee best , oh most Best beleeue it . *stop*
Adieu . *stop*
Thine euermore most deere Lady , whilst this Machine is to him , Hamlet . *stop*
This in Obedience hath my daughter shew 'd me : And more aboue hath his soliciting , As they fell out by Time , by Meanes , and Place , All giuen to mine eare King . *stop*
But how hath she receiu 'd his Loue ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
What do you thinke of me ? *stop*
King . *stop*
As of a man , faithfull and Honourable Pol . *stop*
I wold faine proue so . *stop*
But what might you think ? *stop*
When I had seene this hot loue on the wing , As I perceiued it , I must tell you that Before my Daughter told me what might you Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere , think , If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke , Or giuen my heart a winking , mute and dumbe , Or look 'd vpon this Loue , with idle sight , What might you thinke ? *stop*
No , I went round to worke , And ( my yong Mistris ) thus I did bespeake Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre , This must not be : and then , I Precepts gaue her , That she should locke her selfe from his Resort , Admit no Messengers , receiue no Tokens : Which done , she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice , And he repulsed . *stop*
A short Tale to make , Fell into a Sadnesse , then into a Fast , Thence to a Watch , thence into a Weaknesse , Thence to a Lightnesse , and by this declension Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues , And all we waile for King . *stop*
Do you thinke 't is this ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
It may be very likely Pol . *stop*
Hath there bene such a time , I'de fain know that , That I haue possitiuely said , 't is so , When it prou 'd otherwise ? *stop*
King . *stop*
Not that I know Pol . *stop*
Take this from this ; if this be otherwise , If Circumstances leade me , I will finde Where truth is hid , though it were hid indeede Within the Center King . *stop*
How may we try it further ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
You know sometimes He walkes foure houres together , heere In the Lobby Qu . *stop*
So he ha 's indeed Pol . *stop*
At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him , Be you and I behinde an Arras then , Marke the encounter : If he loue her not , And be not from his reason falne thereon ; Let me be no Assistant for a State , And keepe a Farme and Carters King . *stop*
We will try it . *stop*
Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke . *stop*
Qu . *stop*
But looke where sadly the poore wretch Comes reading Pol . *stop*
Away I do beseech you , both away , Ile boord him presently . *stop*
Exit King & Queen . *stop*
Oh giue me leaue . *stop*
How does my good Lord Hamlet ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Well , God-a-mercy Pol . *stop*
Do you know me , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Excellent , excellent well : y'are a Fishmonger Pol . *stop*
Not I my Lord Ham . *stop*
Then I would you were so honest a man Pol . *stop*
Honest , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I sir , to be honest as this world goes , is to bee one man pick 'd out of two thousand Pol . *stop*
That 's very true , my Lord Ham . *stop*
For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge , being a good kissing Carrion- Haue you a daughter ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
I haue my Lord Ham . *stop*
Let her not walke i'thSunne : Conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceiue . *stop*
Friend looke too't Pol . *stop*
How say you by that ? *stop*
Still harping on my daughter : yet he knew me not at first ; he said I was a Fishmonger : he is farre gone , farre gone : and truly in my youth , I suffred much extreamity for loue : very neere this . *stop*
Ile speake to him againe . *stop*
What do you read my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Words , words , words Pol . *stop*
What is the matter , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Betweene who ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
I meane the matter you meane , my Lord Ham . *stop*
Slanders Sir : for the Satyricall slaue saies here , that old men haue gray Beards ; that their faces are wrinkled ; their eyes purging thicke Amber , or Plum-Tree Gumme : and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit , together with weake Hammes . *stop*
All which Sir , though I most powerfully , and potently beleeue ; yet I holde it not Honestie to haue it thus set downe : For you your selfe Sir , should be old as I am , if like a Crab you could go backward Pol . *stop*
Though this be madnesse , Yet there is Method i n't : will you walke Out of the ayre my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Into my Graue ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
Indeed that is out o'th ' Ayre : How pregnant ( sometimes ) his Replies are ? *stop*
A happinesse , That often Madnesse hits on , Which Reason and Sanitie could not So prosperously be deliuer 'd of . *stop*
I will leaue him , And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting Betweene him , and my daughter . *stop*
My Honourable Lord , I will most humbly Take my leaue of you Ham . *stop*
You can not Sir take from me any thing , that I will more willingly part withall , except my life , my life Polon . *stop*
Fare you well my Lord Ham . *stop*
These tedious old fooles Polon . *stop*
You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet ; there hee is . *stop*
Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne . *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
God saue you Sir Guild . *stop*
Mine honour 'd Lord ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
My most deare Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
My excellent good friends ? *stop*
How do'st thou Guildensterne ? *stop*
Oh , Rosincrane ; good Lads : How doe ye both ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
As the indifferent Children of the earth Guild . *stop*
Happy , in that we are not ouer-happy : on Fortunes Cap , we are not the very Button Ham . *stop*
Nor the Soales of her Shoo ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
Neither my Lord Ham . *stop*
Then you liue about her waste , or in the middle of her fauour ? *stop*
Guil . *stop*
Faith , her priuates , we Ham . *stop*
In the secret parts of Fortune ? *stop*
Oh , most true : she is a Strumpet . *stop*
What 's the newes ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
None my Lord ; but that the World 's growne honest Ham . *stop*
Then is Doomesday neere : But your newes is not true . *stop*
Let me question more in particular : what haue you my good friends , deserued at the hands of Fortune , that she sends you to Prison hither ? *stop*
Guil . *stop*
Prison , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Denmark 's a Prison Rosin . *stop*
Then is the World one Ham . *stop*
A goodly one , in which there are many Confines , Wards , and Dungeons ; Denmarke being one o'th' worst Rosin . *stop*
We thinke not so my Lord Ham . *stop*
Why then 't is none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so : to me it is a prison Rosin . *stop*
Why then your Ambition makes it one : 't is too narrow for your minde Ham . *stop*
O God , I could be bounded in a nutshell , and count my selfe a King of infinite space ; were it not that I haue bad dreames Guil . *stop*
Which dreames indeed are Ambition : for the very substance of the Ambitious , is meerely the shadow of a Dreame Ham . *stop*
A dreame it selfe is but a shadow Rosin . *stop*
Truely , and I hold Ambition of so ayry and light a quality , that it is but a shadowes shadow Ham . *stop*
Then are our Beggers bodies ; and our Monarchs and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes : shall wee to th ' Court : for , by my fey I can not reason ? *stop*
Both . *stop*
Wee ' l wait vpon you Ham . *stop*
No such matter . *stop*
I will not sort you with the rest of my seruants : for to speake to you like an honest man : I am most dreadfully attended ; but in the beaten way of friendship , What make you at Elsonower ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
To visit you my Lord , no other occasion Ham . *stop*
Begger that I am , I am euen poore in thankes ; but I thanke you : and sure deare friends my thanks are too deare a halfepeny ; were you not sent for ? *stop*
Is it your owne inclining ? *stop*
Is it a free visitation ? *stop*
Come , deale iustly with me : come , come ; nay speake Guil . *stop*
What should we say my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Why any thing . *stop*
But to the purpose ; you were sent for ; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes ; which your modesties haue not craft enough to color , I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you Rosin . *stop*
To what end my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
That you must teach me : but let mee coniure you by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue , and by what more deare , a better proposer could charge you withall ; be euen and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no Rosin . *stop*
What say you ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Nay then I haue an eye of you : if you loue me hold not off Guil . *stop*
My Lord , we were sent for Ham . *stop*
I will tell you why ; so shall my anticipation preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and Queene : moult no feather , I haue of late , but wherefore I know not , lost all my mirth , forgone all custome of exercise ; and indeed , it goes so heauenly with my disposition ; that this goodly frame the Earth , seemes to me a sterrill Promontory ; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre , look you , this braue ore-hanging , this Maiesticall Roofe , fretted with golden fire : why , it appeares no other thing to mee , then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours . *stop*
What a piece of worke is a man ! *stop*
how Noble in Reason ? *stop*
how infinite in faculty ? *stop*
in forme and mouing how expresse and admirable ? *stop*
in Action , how like an Angel ? *stop*
in apprehension , how like a God ? *stop*
the beauty of the world , the Parragon of Animals ; and yet to me , what is this Quintessence of Dust ? *stop*
Man delights not me ; no , nor Woman neither ; though by your smiling you seeme to say so Rosin . *stop*
My Lord , there was no such stuffe in my thoughts Ham . *stop*
Why did you laugh , when I said , Man delights not me ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
To thinke , my Lord , if you delight not in Man , what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue from you : wee coated them on the way , and hither are they comming to offer you Seruice Ham . *stop*
He that playes the King shall be welcome ; his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee : the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target : the Louer shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace : the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled a'th ' sere : and the Lady shall say her minde freely ; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't : what Players are they ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
Euen those you were wont to take delight in the Tragedians of the City Ham . *stop*
How chances it they trauaile ? *stop*
their residence both in reputation and profit was better both wayes Rosin . *stop*
I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes of the late Innouation ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Doe they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the City ? *stop*
Are they so follow 'd ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
No indeed , they are not Ham . *stop*
How comes it ? *stop*
doe they grow rusty ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
Nay , their indeauour keepes in the wonted pace ; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children , little Yases , that crye out on the top of question ; and are most tyrannically clap't for't : these are now the fashion , and so be-ratled the common Stages ( so they call them ) that many wearing Rapiers , are affraide of Goose-quils , and dare scarse come thither Ham . *stop*
What are they Children ? *stop*
Who maintains 'em ? *stop*
How are they escorted ? *stop*
Will they pursue the Quality no longer then they can sing ? *stop*
Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues to common Players ( as it is most like if their meanes are not better ) their Writers do them wrong , to make them exclaim against their owne Succession Rosin . *stop*
Faith there ha 's bene much to do on both sides : and the Nation holds it no sinne , to tarre them to Controuersie . *stop*
There was for a while , no mony bid for argument , vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in the Question Ham . *stop*
Is't possible ? *stop*
Guild . *stop*
Oh there ha 's beene much throwing about of Braines Ham . *stop*
Do the Boyes carry it away ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
I that they do my Lord . *stop*
Hercules & his load too Ham . *stop*
It is not strange : for mine Vnckle is King of Denmarke , and those that would make mowes at him while my Father liued ; giue twenty , forty , an hundred Ducates a peece , for his picture in Little . *stop*
There is something in this more then Naturall , if Philosophie could finde it out . *stop*
Flourish for the Players . *stop*
Guil . *stop*
There are the Players Ham . *stop*
Gentlemen , you are welcom to Elsonower : your hands , come : The appurtenance of Welcome , is Fashion and Ceremony . *stop*
Let me comply with you in the Garbe , lest my extent to the Players ( which I tell you must shew fairely outward ) should more appeare like entertainment then yours . *stop*
You are welcome : but my Vnckle Father , and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd Guil . *stop*
In what my deere Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I am but mad North , North-West : when the Winde is Southerly , I know a Hawke from a Handsaw . *stop*
Enter Polonius . *stop*
Pol . *stop*
Well be with you Gentlemen Ham . *stop*
Hearke you Guildensterne , and you too : at each eare a hearer : that great Baby you see there , is not yet out of his swathing clouts Rosin . *stop*
Happily he 's the second time come to them : for they say , an old man is twice a childe Ham . *stop*
I will Prophesie . *stop*
Hee comes to tell me of the Players . *stop*
Mark it , you say right Sir : for a Monday morning 'twas so indeed Pol . *stop*
My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you Ham . *stop*
My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you . *stop*
When Rossius an Actor in Rome- Pol . *stop*
The Actors are come hither my Lord Ham . *stop*
Buzze , buzze Pol . *stop*
Vpon mine Honor Ham . *stop*
Then can each Actor on his Asse- Polon . *stop*
The best Actors in the world , either for Tragedie , Comedie , Historie , Pastorall : Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall : Tragicall-Historicall : Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall : Scene indiuidible : or Poem vnlimited . *stop*
Seneca can not be too heauy , nor Plautus too light , for the law of Writ , and the Liberty . *stop*
These are the onely men Ham . *stop*
O Iephta Iudge of Israel , what a Treasure had'st thou ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
What a Treasure had he , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Why one faire Daughter , and no more , The which he loued passing well Pol . *stop*
Still on my Daughter Ham . *stop*
Am I not i'th ' right old Iephta ? *stop*
Polon . *stop*
If you call me Iephta my Lord , I haue a daughter that I loue passing well Ham . *stop*
Nay that followes not Polon . *stop*
What followes then , my Lord ? *stop*
Ha . *stop*
Why , As by lot , God wot : and then you know , It came to passe , as most like it was : The first rowe of the Pons Chanson will shew you more . *stop*
For looke where my Abridgements come . *stop*
Enter foure or fiue Players . *stop*
Y'are welcome Masters , welcome all . *stop*
I am glad to see thee well : Welcome good Friends . *stop*
Oh my olde Friend ? *stop*
Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last : Com'st thou to beard me in Denmarke ? *stop*
What , my yong Lady and Mistris ? *stop*
Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when I saw you last , by the altitude of a Choppine . *stop*
Pray God your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd within the ring . *stop*
Masters , you are all welcome : wee ' l e'ne to't like French Faulconers , flie at any thing we see : wee ' l haue a Speech straight . *stop*
Come giue vs a tast of your quality : come , a passionate speech 1.Play . *stop*
What speech , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was neuer Acted : or if it was , not aboue once , for the Play I remember pleas 'd not the Million , 't was Cauiarie to the Generall : but it was ( as I receiu 'd it , and others , whose iudgement in such matters , cried in the top of mine ) an excellent Play ; well digested in the Scoenes , set downe with as much modestie , as cunning . *stop*
I remember one said , there was no Sallets in the lines , to make the matter sauory ; nor no matter in the phrase , that might indite the Author of affectation , but cal 'd it an honest method . *stop*
One cheefe Speech in it , I cheefely lou 'd , 't was Aeneas Tale to Dido , and thereabout of it especially , where he speaks of Priams slaughter . *stop*
If it liue in your memory , begin at this Line , let me see , let me see : The rugged Pyrrhus like th'Hyrcanian Beast . *stop*
It is not so : it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus , he whose Sable Armes Blacke as his purpose , did the night resemble When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse , Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd With Heraldry more dismall : Head to foote Now is he to take Geulles , horridly Trick'd With blood of Fathers , Mothers , Daughters , Sonnes , Bak 'd and impasted with the parching streets , That lend a tyrannous , and damned light To their vilde Murthers , roasted in wrath and fire , And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore , With eyes like Carbuncles , the hellish Pyrrhus Olde Grandsire Priam seekes Pol . *stop*
Fore God , my Lord , well spoken , with good accent , and good discretion 1.Player . *stop*
Anon he findes him , Striking too short at Greekes . *stop*
His anticke Sword , Rebellious to his Arme , lyes where it falles Repugnant to command : vnequall match , Pyrrhus at Priam driues , in Rage strikes wide : But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword , Th ' vnnerued Father fals . *stop*
Then senselesse Illium , Seeming to feele his blow , with flaming top Stoopes to his Bace , and with a hideous crash Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare . *stop*
For loe , his Sword Which was declining on the Milkie head Of Reuerend Priam , seem 'd i'th ' Ayre to sticke : So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood , And like a Newtrall to his will and matter , did nothing . *stop*
But as we often see against some storme , A silence in the Heauens , the Racke stand still , The bold windes speechlesse , and the Orbe below As hush as death : Anon the dreadfull Thunder Doth rend the Region . *stop*
So after Pyrrhus pause , A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke , And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars his Armours , forg 'd for proofe Eterne , With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falles on Priam . *stop*
Out , out , thou Strumpet-Fortune , all you Gods , In generall Synod take away her power : Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele , And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen , As low as to the Fiends Pol . *stop*
This is too long Ham . *stop*
It shall to'th Barbars , with your beard . *stop*
Prythee say on : He 's for a Iigge , or a tale of Baudry , or hee sleepes . *stop*
Say on ; come to Hecuba 1.Play . *stop*
But who , O who , had seen the inobled Queen Ham . *stop*
The inobled Queene ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
That 's good : Inobled Queene is good 1.Play . *stop*
Run bare-foot vp and downe , Threatning the flame With Bisson Rheume : A clout about that head , Where late the Diadem stood , and for a Robe About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines , A blanket in th ' Alarum of feare caught vp . *stop*
Who this had seene , with tongue in Venome steep 'd , 'Gainst Fortunes State , would Treason haue pronounc 'd ? *stop*
But if the Gods themselues did see her then , When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes , The instant Burst of Clamour that she made ( Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all ) Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen , And passion in the Gods Pol . *stop*
Looke where he ha 's not turn 'd his colour , and ha 's teares in 's eyes . *stop*
Pray you no more Ham . *stop*
'T is well , Ile haue thee speake out the rest , soone . *stop*
Good my Lord , will you see the Players wel bestow 'd . *stop*
Do ye heare , let them be well vs 'd : for they are the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time . *stop*
After your death , you were better haue a bad Epitaph , then their ill report while you liued Pol . *stop*
My Lord , I will vse them according to their desart Ham . *stop*
Gods bodykins man , better . *stop*
Vse euerie man after his desart , and who should scape whipping : vse them after your own Honor and Dignity . *stop*
The lesse they deserue , the more merit is in your bountie . *stop*
Take them in Pol . *stop*
Come sirs . *stop*
Exit Polon . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Follow him Friends : wee ' l heare a play to morrow . *stop*
Dost thou heare me old Friend , can you play the murther of Gonzago ? *stop*
Play . *stop*
I my Lord Ham . *stop*
Wee ' l ha't to morrow night . *stop*
You could for a need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines , which I would set downe , and insert i n't ? *stop*
Could ye not ? *stop*
Play . *stop*
I my Lord Ham . *stop*
Very well . *stop*
Follow that Lord , and looke you mock him not . *stop*
My good Friends , Ile leaue you til night you are welcome to Elsonower ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
Good my Lord . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Manet Hamlet . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I so , God buy'ye : Now I am alone . *stop*
Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I ? *stop*
Is it not monstrous that this Player heere , But in a Fixion , in a dreame of Passion , Could force his soule so to his whole conceit , That from her working , all his visage warm 'd ; Teares in his eyes , distraction in 's Aspect , A broken voyce , and his whole Function suiting With Formes , to his Conceit ? *stop*
And all for nothing ? *stop*
For Hecuba ? *stop*
What 's Hecuba to him , or he to Hecuba , That he should weepe for her ? *stop*
What would he doe , Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion That I haue ? *stop*
He would drowne the Stage with teares , And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech : Make mad the guilty , and apale the free , Confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed , The very faculty of Eyes and Eares . *stop*
Yet I , A dull and muddy-metled Rascall , peake Like Iohn a-dreames , vnpregnant of my cause , And can say nothing : No , not for a King , Vpon whose property , and most deere life , A damn 'd defeate was made . *stop*
Am I a Coward ? *stop*
Who calles me Villaine ? *stop*
breakes my pate a-crosse ? *stop*
Pluckes off my Beard , and blowes it in my face ? *stop*
Tweakes me by'th ' Nose ? *stop*
giues me the Lye i'th ' Throate , As deepe as to the Lungs ? *stop*
Who does me this ? *stop*
Ha ? *stop*
Why I should take it : for it can not be , But I am Pigeon-Liuer 'd , and lacke Gall To make Oppression bitter , or ere this , I should haue fatted all the Region Kites With this Slaues Offall , bloudy : a Bawdy villaine , Remorselesse , Treacherous , Letcherous , kindles villaine ! *stop*
Oh Vengeance ! *stop*
Who ? *stop*
What an Asse am I ? *stop*
I sure , this is most braue , That I , the Sonne of the Deere murthered , Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen , and Hell , Must ( like a Whore ) vnpacke my heart with words , And fall a Cursing like a very Drab . *stop*
A Scullion ? *stop*
Fye vpo n't : Foh . *stop*
About my Braine . *stop*
I haue heard , that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play , Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene , Bene strooke so to the soule , that presently They haue proclaim 'd their Malefactions . *stop*
For Murther , though it haue no tongue , will speake With most myraculous Organ . *stop*
Ile haue these Players , Play something like the murder of my Father , Before mine Vnkle . *stop*
Ile obserue his lookes , Ile rent him to the quicke : If he but blench I know my course . *stop*
The Spirit that I haue seene May be the Diuell , and the Diuel hath power T ' assume a pleasing shape , yea and perhaps Out of my Weaknesse , and my Melancholly , As he is very potent with such Spirits , Abuses me to damne me . *stop*
Ile haue grounds More Relatiue then this : The Play 's the thing , Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King . *stop*
Exit Enter King , Queene , Polonius , Ophelia , Rosincrance , Guildenstern , and Lords . *stop*
King . *stop*
And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this Confusion : Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy Rosin . *stop*
He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted , But from what cause he will by no meanes speake Guil . *stop*
Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded , But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe : When we would bring him on to some Confession Of his true state Qu . *stop*
Did he receiue you well ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
Most like a Gentleman Guild . *stop*
But with much forcing of his disposition Rosin . *stop*
Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply Qu . *stop*
Did you assay him to any pastime ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
Madam , it so fell out , that certaine Players We ore-wrought on the way : of these we told him , And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy To heare of it : They are about the Court , And ( as I thinke ) they haue already order This night to play before him Pol . *stop*
'T is most true : And he beseech 'd me to intreate your Maiesties To heare , and see the matter King . *stop*
With all my heart , and it doth much content me To heare him so inclin 'd . *stop*
Good Gentlemen , Giue him a further edge , and driue his purpose on To these delights Rosin . *stop*
We shall my Lord . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
King . *stop*
Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too , For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither , That he , as 'twere by accident , may there Affront Ophelia . *stop*
Her Father , and my selfe ( lawful espials ) Will so bestow our selues , that seeing vnseene We may of their encounter frankely iudge , And gather by him , as he is behaued , If't be th ' affliction of his loue , or no . *stop*
That thus he suffers for Qu . *stop*
I shall obey you , And for your part Ophelia , I do wish That your good Beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildenesse : so shall I hope your Vertues Will bring him to his wonted way againe , To both your Honors Ophe . *stop*
Madam , I wish it may Pol . *stop*
Ophelia , walke you heere . *stop*
Gracious so please ye We will bestow our selues : Reade on this booke , That shew of such an exercise may colour Your lonelinesse . *stop*
We are oft too blame in this , 'Tis too much prou 'd , that with Deuotions visage , And pious Action , we do surge o're The diuell himselfe King . *stop*
Oh 't is true : How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience ? *stop*
The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it , Then is my deede , to my most painted word . *stop*
Oh heauie burthen ! *stop*
Pol . *stop*
I heare him comming , let 's withdraw my Lord . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter Hamlet . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
To be , or not to be , that is the Question : Whether 't is Nobler in the minde to suffer The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune , Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles , And by opposing end them : to dye , to sleepe No more ; and by a sleepe , to say we end The Heart-ake , and the thousand Naturall shockes That Flesh is heyre too ? *stop*
'T is a consummation Deuoutly to be wish 'd . *stop*
To dye to sleepe , To sleepe , perchance to Dreame ; I , there 's the rub , For in that sleepe of death , what dreames may come , When we haue shuffel 'd off this mortall coile , Must giue vs pawse . *stop*
There 's the respect That makes Calamity of so long life : For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time , The Oppressors wrong , the poore mans Contumely , The pangs of dispriz 'd Loue , the Lawes delay , The insolence of Office , and the Spurnes That patient merit of the vnworthy takes , When he himselfe might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin ? *stop*
Who would these Fardles beare To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The vndiscouered Countrey , from whose Borne No Traueller returnes , Puzels the will , And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue , Then flye to others that we know not of . *stop*
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all , And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution Is sicklied o 're , with the pale cast of Thought , And enterprizes of great pith and moment , With this regard their Currants turne away , And loose the name of Action . *stop*
Soft you now , The faire Ophelia ? *stop*
Nimph , in thy Orizons Be all my sinnes remembred Ophe . *stop*
Good my Lord , How does your Honor for this many a day ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I humbly thanke you : well , well , well Ophe . *stop*
My Lord , I haue Remembrances of yours , That I haue longed long to re-deliuer . *stop*
I pray you now , receiue them Ham . *stop*
No , no , I neuer gaue you ought Ophe . *stop*
My honor 'd Lord , I know right well you did , And with them words of so sweet breath compos 'd , As made the things more rich , then perfume left : Take these againe , for to the Noble minde Rich gifts wax poore , when giuers proue vnkinde . *stop*
There my Lord Ham . *stop*
Ha , ha : Are you honest ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
My Lord Ham . *stop*
Are you faire ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
What meanes your Lordship ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
That if you be honest and faire , your Honesty should admit no discourse to your Beautie Ophe . *stop*
Could Beautie my Lord , haue better Comerce then your Honestie ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I trulie : for the power of Beautie , will sooner transforme Honestie from what is , to a Bawd , then the force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse . *stop*
This was sometime a Paradox , but now the time giues it proofe . *stop*
I did loue you once Ophe . *stop*
Indeed my Lord , you made me beleeue so Ham . *stop*
You should not haue beleeued me . *stop*
For vertue can not so innocculate our old stocke , but we shall rellish of it . *stop*
I loued you not Ophe . *stop*
I was the more deceiued Ham . *stop*
Get thee to a Nunnerie . *stop*
Why would'st thou be a breeder of Sinners ? *stop*
I am my selfe indifferent honest , but yet I could accuse me of such things , that it were better my Mother had not borne me . *stop*
I am very prowd , reuengefull , Ambitious , with more offences at my becke , then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination , to giue them shape , or time to acte them in . *stop*
What should such Fellowes as I do , crawling betweene Heauen and Earth . *stop*
We are arrant Knaues all , beleeue none of vs. Goe thy wayes to a Nunnery . *stop*
Where 's your Father ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
At home , my Lord Ham . *stop*
Let the doores be shut vpon him , that he may play the Foole no way , but in 's owne house . *stop*
Farewell Ophe . *stop*
O helpe him , you sweet Heauens Ham . *stop*
If thou doest Marry , Ile giue thee this Plague for thy Dowrie . *stop*
Be thou as chast as Ice , as pure as Snow , thou shalt not escape Calumny . *stop*
Get thee to a Nunnery . *stop*
Go , Farewell . *stop*
Or if thou wilt needs Marry , marry a fool : for Wise men know well enough , what monsters you make of them . *stop*
To a Nunnery go , and quickly too . *stop*
Farwell Ophe . *stop*
O heauenly Powers , restore him Ham . *stop*
I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough . *stop*
God has giuen you one pace , and you make your selfe another : you gidge , you amble , and you lispe , and nickname Gods creatures , and make your Wantonnesse , your Ignorance . *stop*
Go too , Ile no more o n't , it hath made me mad . *stop*
I say , we will haue no more Marriages . *stop*
Those that are married already , all but one shall liue , the rest shall keep as they are . *stop*
To a Nunnery , go . *stop*
Exit Hamlet . *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne ? *stop*
The Courtiers , Soldiers , Schollers : Eye , tongue , sword , Th ' expectansie and Rose of the faire State , The glasse of Fashion , and the mould of Forme , Th ' obseru 'd of all Obseruers , quite , quite downe . *stop*
Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched , That suck 'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes : Now see that Noble , and most Soueraigne Reason , Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune , and harsh , That vnmatch 'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth , Blasted with extasie . *stop*
Oh woe is me , T'haue seene what I haue seene : see what I see . *stop*
Enter King , and Polonius . *stop*
King . *stop*
Loue ? *stop*
His affections do not that way tend , Nor what he spake , though it lack 'd Forme a little , Was not like Madnesse . *stop*
There 's something in his soule ? *stop*
O 're which his Melancholly sits on brood , And I do doubt the hatch , and the disclose Will be some danger , which to preuent I haue in quicke determination Thus set it downe . *stop*
He shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected Tribute : Haply the Seas and Countries different With variable Obiects , shall expell This something setled matter in his heart : Whereon his Braines still beating , puts him thus From fashion of himselfe . *stop*
What thinke you o n't ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
It shall do well . *stop*
But yet do I beleeue The Origin and Commencement of this greefe Sprung from neglected loue . *stop*
How now Ophelia ? *stop*
You neede not tell vs , what Lord Hamlet saide , We heard it all . *stop*
My Lord , do as you please , But if you hold it fit after the Play , Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him To shew his Greefes : let her be round with him , And Ile be plac 'd so , please you in the eare Of all their Conference . *stop*
If she finde him not , To England send him : Or confine him where Your wisedome best shall thinke King . *stop*
It shall be so : Madnesse in great Ones , must not vnwatch 'd go . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter Hamlet , and two or three of the Players . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Speake the Speech I pray you , as I pronounc'd it to you trippingly on the Tongue : But if you mouth it , as many of your Players do , I had as liue the Town-Cryer had spoke my Lines : Nor do not saw the Ayre too much your hand thus , but vse all gently ; for in the verie Torrent , Tempest , and ( as I say ) the Whirle-winde of Passion , you must acquire and beget a Temperance that may giue it Smoothnesse . *stop*
O it offends mee to the Soule , to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow , teare a Passion to tatters , to verie ragges , to split the eares of the Groundlings : who ( for the most part ) are capeable of nothing , but inexplicable dumbe shewes , & noise : I could haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant : it outHerod 's Herod . *stop*
Pray you auoid it Player . *stop*
I warrant your Honor Ham . *stop*
Be not too tame neyther : but let your owne Discretion be your Tutor . *stop*
Sute the Action to the Word , the Word to the Action , with this speciall obseruance : That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature ; for any thing so ouer-done , is fro [ m ] the purpose of Playing , whose end both at the first and now , was and is , to hold as 'twer the Mirrour vp to Nature ; to shew Vertue her owne Feature , Scorne her owne Image , and the verie Age and Bodie of the Time , his forme and pressure . *stop*
Now , this ouer-done , or come tardie off , though it make the vnskilfull laugh , can not but make the Iudicious greeue ; The censure of the which One , must in your allowance o'reway a whole Theater of Others . *stop*
Oh , there bee Players that I haue seene Play , and heard others praise , and that highly ( not to speake it prophanely ) that neyther hauing the accent of Christians , nor the gate of Christian , Pagan , or Norman , haue so strutted and bellowed , that I haue thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men , and not made them well , they imitated Humanity so abhominably Play . *stop*
I hope we haue reform 'd that indifferently with vs , Sir Ham . *stop*
O reforme it altogether . *stop*
And let those that play your Clownes , speake no more then is set downe for them . *stop*
For there be of them , that will themselues laugh , to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh too , though in the meane time , some necessary Question of the Play be then to be considered : that 's Villanous , & shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses it . *stop*
Go make you readie . *stop*
Exit Players . *stop*
Enter Polonius , Rosincrance , and Guildensterne . *stop*
How now my Lord , Will the King heare this peece of Worke ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
And the Queene too , and that presently Ham . *stop*
Bid the Players make hast . *stop*
Exit Polonius . *stop*
Will you two helpe to hasten them ? *stop*
Both . *stop*
We will my Lord . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter Horatio . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
What hoa , Horatio ? *stop*
Hora . *stop*
Heere sweet Lord , at your Seruice Ham . *stop*
Horatio , thou art eene as iust a man As ere my Conuersation coap 'd withall Hora . *stop*
O my deere Lord Ham . *stop*
Nay , do not thinke I flatter : For what aduancement may I hope from thee , That no Reuennew hast , but thy good spirits To feed & cloath thee . *stop*
Why shold the poor be flatter 'd ? *stop*
No , let the Candied tongue , like absurd pompe , And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee , Where thrift may follow faining ? *stop*
Dost thou heare , Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse , And could of men distinguish , her election Hath seal 'd thee for her selfe . *stop*
For thou hast bene As one in suffering all , that suffers nothing . *stop*
A man that Fortunes buffets , and Rewards Hath 'tane with equall Thankes . *stop*
And blest are those , Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled , That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger . *stop*
To sound what stop she please . *stop*
Giue me that man , That is not Passions Slaue , and I will weare him In my hearts Core . *stop*
I , in my Heart of heart , As I do thee . *stop*
Something too much of this . *stop*
There is a Play to night to before the King . *stop*
One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance Which I haue told thee , of my Fathers death . *stop*
I prythee , when thou see'st that Acte a-foot , Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule Obserue mine Vnkle : If his occulted guilt , Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech , It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene : And my Imaginations are as foule As Vulcans Stythe . *stop*
Giue him needfull note , For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face : And after we will both our iudgements ioyne , To censure of his seeming Hora . *stop*
Well my Lord . *stop*
If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing , And scape detecting , I will pay the Theft . *stop*
Enter King , Queene , Polonius , Ophelia , Rosincrance , Guildensterne , and other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches . *stop*
Danish March . *stop*
Sound a Flourish . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
They are comming to the Play : I must be idle . *stop*
Get you a place King . *stop*
How fares our Cosin Hamlet ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Excellent Ifaith , of the Camelions dish : I eate the Ayre promise-cramm 'd , you can not feed Capons so King . *stop*
I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet , these words are not mine Ham . *stop*
No , nor mine . *stop*
Now my Lord , you plaid once i'th ' Vniuersity , you say ? *stop*
Polon . *stop*
That I did my Lord , and was accounted a good Actor Ham . *stop*
And what did you enact ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
I did enact Iulius Caesar , I was kill 'd i'th ' Capitol : Brutus kill 'd me Ham . *stop*
It was a bruite part of him , to kill so Capitall a Calfe there . *stop*
Be the Players ready ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
I my Lord , they stay vpon your patience Qu . *stop*
Come hither my good Hamlet , sit by me Ha . *stop*
No good Mother , here 's Mettle more attractiue Pol . *stop*
Oh ho , do you marke that ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Ladie , shall I lye in your Lap ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
No my Lord Ham . *stop*
I meane , my Head vpon your Lap ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
I my Lord Ham . *stop*
Do you thinke I meant Country matters ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
I thinke nothing , my Lord Ham . *stop*
That 's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs Ophe . *stop*
What is my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Nothing Ophe . *stop*
You are merrie , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Who I ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
I my Lord Ham . *stop*
Oh God , your onely Iigge-maker : what should a man do , but be merrie . *stop*
For looke you how cheerefully my Mother lookes , and my Father dyed within 's two Houres Ophe . *stop*
Nay , 't is twice two moneths , my Lord Ham . *stop*
So long ? *stop*
Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke , for Ile haue a suite of Sables . *stop*
Oh Heauens ! *stop*
dye two moneths ago , and not forgotten yet ? *stop*
Then there 's hope , a great mans Memorie , may out-liue his life halfe a yeare : But byrlady he must builde Churches then : or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the Hoby-horsse , whose Epitaph is , For o , For o , the Hoby-horse is forgot . *stop*
Hoboyes play . *stop*
The dumbe shew enters . *stop*
Enter a King and Queene , very louingly ; the Queene embracing him . *stop*
She kneeles , and makes shew of Protestation vnto him . *stop*
He takes her vp , and declines his head vpon her neck . *stop*
Layes him downe vpon a Banke of Flowers . *stop*
She seeing him a-sleepe , leaues him . *stop*
Anon comes in a Fellow , takes off his Crowne , kisses it , and powres poyson in the Kings eares , and Exits . *stop*
The Queene returnes , findes the King dead , and makes passionate Action . *stop*
The Poysoner , with some two or three Mutes comes in againe , seeming to lament with her . *stop*
The dead body is carried away : The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with Gifts , she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile , but in the end , accepts his loue . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
What meanes this , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Marry this is Miching Malicho , that meanes Mischeefe Ophe . *stop*
Belike this shew imports the Argument of the Play ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
We shall know by these Fellowes : the Players can not keepe counsell , they ' l tell all Ophe . *stop*
Will they tell vs what this shew meant ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I , or any shew that you ' l shew him . *stop*
Bee not you asham 'd to shew , hee ' l not shame to tell you what it meanes Ophe . *stop*
You are naught , you are naught , Ile marke the Play . *stop*
Enter Prologue . *stop*
For vs , and for our Tragedie , Heere stooping to your Clemencie : We begge your hearing Patientlie Ham . *stop*
Is this a Prologue , or the Poesie of a Ring ? *stop*
Ophe . *stop*
'T is briefe my Lord Ham . *stop*
As Womans loue . *stop*
Enter King and his Queene . *stop*
King . *stop*
Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round , Neptunes salt Wash , and Tellus Orbed ground : And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene , About the World haue times twelue thirties beene , Since loue our hearts , and Hymen did our hands Vnite comutuall , in most sacred Bands Bap . *stop*
So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone Make vs againe count o 're , ere loue be done . *stop*
But woe is me , you are so sicke of late , So farre from cheere , and from your former state , That I distrust you : yet though I distrust , Discomfort you ( my Lord ) it nothing must : For womens Feare and Loue , holds quantitie , In neither ought , or in extremity : Now what my loue is , proofe hath made you know , And as my Loue is siz 'd , my Feare is so King . *stop*
Faith I must leaue thee Loue , and shortly too : My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do : And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde , Honour 'd , belou 'd , and haply , one as kinde . *stop*
For Husband shalt thou- Bap . *stop*
Oh confound the rest : Such Loue , must needs be Treason in my brest : In second Husband , let me be accurst , None wed the second , but who kill 'd the first Ham . *stop*
Wormwood , Wormwood Bapt . *stop*
The instances that second Marriage moue , Are base respects of Thrift , but none of Loue . *stop*
A second time , I kill my Husband dead , When second Husband kisses me in Bed King . *stop*
I do beleeue you . *stop*
Think what now you speak : But what we do determine , oft we breake : Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie , Of violent Birth , but poore validitie : Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree , But fall vnshaken , when they mellow bee . *stop*
Most necessary 't is , that we forget To pay our selues , what to our selues is debt : What to our selues in passion we propose , The passion ending , doth the purpose lose . *stop*
The violence of other Greefe or Ioy , Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy : Where Ioy most Reuels , Greefe doth most lament ; Greefe ioyes , Ioy greeues on slender accident . *stop*
This world is not for aye , nor 't is not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change . *stop*
For 't is a question left vs yet to proue , Whether Loue lead Fortune , or else Fortune Loue . *stop*
The great man downe , you marke his fauourites flies , The poore aduanc 'd , makes Friends of Enemies : And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend , For who not needs , shall neuer lacke a Frend : And who in want a hollow Friend doth try , Directly seasons him his Enemie . *stop*
But orderly to end , where I begun , Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run , That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne , Our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our owne . *stop*
So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed . *stop*
But die thy thoughts , when thy first Lord is dead Bap . *stop*
Nor Earth to giue me food , nor Heauen light , Sport and repose locke from me day and night : Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy , Meet what I would haue well , and it destroy : Both heere , and hence , pursue me lasting strife , If once a Widdow , euer I be Wife Ham . *stop*
If she should breake it now King . *stop*
'T is deepely sworne : Sweet , leaue me heere a while , My spirits grow dull , and faine I would beguile The tedious day with sleepe Qu . *stop*
Sleepe rocke thy Braine , Sleepes And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine . *stop*
Exit Ham . *stop*
Madam , how like you this Play ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
The Lady protests to much me thinkes Ham . *stop*
Oh but shee ' l keepe her word King . *stop*
Haue you heard the Argument , is there no Offence i n't ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
No , no , they do but iest , poyson in iest , no Offence i'th ' world King . *stop*
What do you call the Play ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
The Mouse-trap : Marry how ? *stop*
Tropically : This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna : Gonzago is the Dukes name , his wife Baptista : you shall see anon : 't is a knauish peece of worke : But what o'that ? *stop*
Your Maiestie , and wee that haue free soules , it touches vs not : let the gall 'd iade winch : our withers are vnrung . *stop*
Enter Lucianus . *stop*
This is one Lucianus nephew to the King Ophe . *stop*
You are a good Chorus , my Lord Ham . *stop*
I could interpret betweene you and your loue : if I could see the Puppets dallying Ophe . *stop*
You are keene my Lord , you are keene Ham . *stop*
It would cost you a groaning , to take off my edge Ophe . *stop*
Still better and worse Ham . *stop*
So you mistake Husbands . *stop*
Begin Murderer . *stop*
Pox , leaue thy damnable Faces , and begin . *stop*
Come , the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge Lucian . *stop*
Thoughts blacke , hands apt , Drugges fit , and Time agreeing : Confederate season , else , no Creature seeing : Thou mixture ranke , of Midnight Weeds collected , With Hecats Ban , thrice blasted , thrice infected , Thy naturall Magicke , and dire propertie , On wholsome life , vsurpe immediately . *stop*
Powres the poyson in his eares . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
He poysons him i'th ' Garden for 's estate : His name 's Gonzago : the Story is extant and writ in choyce Italian . *stop*
You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the loue of Gonzago 's wife Ophe . *stop*
The King rises Ham . *stop*
What , frighted with false fire Qu . *stop*
How fares my Lord ? *stop*
Pol . *stop*
Giue o 're the Play King . *stop*
Giue me some Light . *stop*
Away All . *stop*
Lights , Lights , Lights . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Manet Hamlet & Horatio . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Why let the strucken Deere go weepe , The Hart vngalled play : For some must watch , while some must sleepe ; So runnes the world away . *stop*
Would not this Sir , and a Forrest of Feathers , if the rest of my Fortunes turne Turke with me ; with two Prouinciall Roses on my rac 'd Shooes , get me a Fellowship in a crie of Players sir Hor . *stop*
Halfe a share Ham . *stop*
A whole one I , For thou dost know : Oh Damon deere , This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe , And now reignes heere . *stop*
A verie verie Paiocke Hora . *stop*
You might haue Rim'd Ham . *stop*
Oh good Horatio , Ile take the Ghosts word for a thousand pound . *stop*
Did'st perceiue ? *stop*
Hora . *stop*
Verie well my Lord Ham . *stop*
Vpon the talke of the poysoning ? *stop*
Hora . *stop*
I did verie well note him . *stop*
Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Oh , ha ? *stop*
Come some Musick . *stop*
Come y Recorders : For if the King like not the Comedie , Why then belike he likes it not perdie . *stop*
Come some Musicke Guild . *stop*
Good my Lord , vouchsafe me a word with you Ham . *stop*
Sir , a whole History Guild . *stop*
The King , sir Ham . *stop*
I sir , what of him ? *stop*
Guild . *stop*
Is in his retyrement , maruellous distemper'd Ham . *stop*
With drinke Sir ? *stop*
Guild . *stop*
No my Lord , rather with choller Ham . *stop*
Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer , to signifie this to his Doctor : for for me to put him to his Purgation , would perhaps plundge him into farre more Choller Guild . *stop*
Good my Lord put your discourse into some frame , and start not so wildely from my affayre Ham . *stop*
I am tame Sir , pronounce Guild . *stop*
The Queene your Mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you Ham . *stop*
You are welcome Guild . *stop*
Nay , good my Lord , this courtesie is not of the right breed . *stop*
If it shall please you to make me a wholsome answer , I will doe your Mothers command'ment : if not , your pardon , and my returne shall bee the end of my Businesse Ham . *stop*
Sir , I can not Guild . *stop*
What , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Make you a wholsome answere : my wits diseas 'd . *stop*
But sir , such answers as I can make , you shal command : or rather you say , my Mother : therfore no more but to the matter . *stop*
My Mother you say Rosin . *stop*
Then thus she sayes : your behauior hath stroke her into amazement , and admiration Ham . *stop*
Oh wonderfull Sonne , that can so astonish a Mother . *stop*
But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers admiration ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
She desires to speake with you in her Closset , ere you go to bed Ham . *stop*
We shall obey , were she ten times our Mother . *stop*
Haue you any further Trade with vs ? *stop*
Rosin . *stop*
My Lord , you once did loue me Ham . *stop*
So I do still , by these pickers and stealers Rosin . *stop*
Good my Lord , what is your cause of distemper ? *stop*
You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie , if you deny your greefes to your Friend Ham . *stop*
Sir I lacke Aduancement Rosin . *stop*
How can that be , when you haue the voyce of the King himselfe , for your Succession in Denmarke ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I , but while the grasse growes , the Prouerbe is something musty . *stop*
Enter one with a Recorder . *stop*
O the Recorder . *stop*
Let me see , to withdraw with you , why do you go about to recouer the winde of mee , as if you would driue me into a toyle ? *stop*
Guild . *stop*
O my Lord , if my Dutie be too bold , my loue is too vnmannerly Ham . *stop*
I do not well vnderstand that . *stop*
Will you play vpon this Pipe ? *stop*
Guild . *stop*
My Lord , I can not Ham . *stop*
I pray you Guild . *stop*
Beleeue me , I can not Ham . *stop*
I do beseech you Guild . *stop*
I know no touch of it , my Lord Ham . *stop*
'T is as easie as lying : gouerne these Ventiges with your finger and thumbe , giue it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most excellent Musicke . *stop*
Looke you , these are the stoppes Guild . *stop*
But these can not I command to any vtterance of hermony , I haue not the skill Ham . *stop*
Why looke you now , how vnworthy a thing you make of me : you would play vpon mee ; you would seeme to know my stops : you would pluck out the heart of my Mysterie ; you would sound mee from my lowest Note , to the top of my Compasse : and there is much Musicke , excellent Voice , in this little Organe , yet can not you make it . *stop*
Why do you thinke , that I am easier to bee plaid on , then a Pipe ? *stop*
Call me what Instrument you will , though you can fret me , you can not play vpon me . *stop*
God blesse you Sir . *stop*
Enter Polonius . *stop*
Polon . *stop*
My Lord ; the Queene would speak with you , and presently Ham . *stop*
Do you see that Clowd ? *stop*
that 's almost in shape like a Camell Polon . *stop*
By'th ' Masse , and it 's like a Camell indeed Ham . *stop*
Me thinkes it is like a Weazell Polon . *stop*
It is back 'd like a Weazell Ham . *stop*
Or like a Whale ? *stop*
Polon . *stop*
Verie like a Whale Ham . *stop*
Then will I come to my Mother , by and by : They foole me to the top of my bent . *stop*
I will come by and by Polon . *stop*
I will say so . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
By and by , is easily said . *stop*
Leaue me Friends : 'Tis now the verie witching time of night , When Churchyards yawne , and Hell it selfe breaths out Contagion to this world . *stop*
Now could I drink hot blood , And do such bitter businesse as the day Would quake to looke on . *stop*
Soft now , to my Mother : Oh Heart , loose not thy Nature ; let not euer The Soule of Nero , enter this firme bosome : Let me be cruell , not vnnaturall , I will speake Daggers to her , but vse none : My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites . *stop*
How in my words someuer she be shent , To giue them Seales , neuer my Soule consent . *stop*
Enter King , Rosincrance , and Guildensterne . *stop*
King . *stop*
I like him not , nor stands it safe with vs , To let his madnesse range . *stop*
Therefore prepare you , I your Commission will forthwith dispatch , And he to England shall along with you : The termes of our estate , may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow Out of his Lunacies Guild . *stop*
We will our selues prouide : Most holie and Religious feare it is To keepe those many many bodies safe That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie Rosin . *stop*
The single And peculiar life is bound With all the strength and Armour of the minde , To keepe it selfe from noyance : but much more , That Spirit , vpon whose spirit depends and rests The liues of many , the cease of Maiestie Dies not alone ; but like a Gulfe doth draw What 's neere it , with it . *stop*
It is a massie wheele Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount . *stop*
To whose huge Spoakes , ten thousand lesser things Are mortiz 'd and adioyn 'd : which when it falles , Each small annexment , pettie consequence Attends the boystrous Ruine . *stop*
Neuer alone Did the King sighe , but with a generall grone King . *stop*
Arme you , I pray you to this speedie Voyage ; For we will Fetters put vpon this feare , Which now goes too free-footed Both . *stop*
We will haste vs. Exeunt . *stop*
Gent . *stop*
Enter Polonius . *stop*
Pol . *stop*
My Lord , he 's going to his Mothers Closset : Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe To heare the Processe . *stop*
Ile warrant shee ' l tax him home , And as you said , and wisely was it said , 'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother , Since Nature makes them partiall , should o're-heare The speech of vantage . *stop*
Fare you well my Liege , Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed , And tell you what I know King . *stop*
Thankes deere my Lord . *stop*
Oh my offence is ranke , it smels to heauen , It hath the primall eldest curse vpo n't , A Brothers murther . *stop*
Pray can I not , Though inclination be as sharpe as will : My stronger guilt , defeats my strong intent , And like a man to double businesse bound , I stand in pause where I shall first begin , And both neglect ; what if this cursed hand Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood , Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens To wash it white as Snow ? *stop*
Whereto serues mercy , But to confront the visage of Offence ? *stop*
And what 's in Prayer , but this two-fold force , To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall , Or pardon 'd being downe ? *stop*
Then Ile looke vp , My fault is past . *stop*
But oh , what forme of Prayer Can serue my turne ? *stop*
Forgiue me my foule Murther : That can not be , since I am still possest Of those effects for which I did the Murther . *stop*
My Crowne , mine owne Ambition , and my Queene : May one be pardon 'd , and retaine th ' offence ? *stop*
In the corrupted currants of this world , Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice , And oft 't is seene , the wicked prize it selfe Buyes out the Law ; but 't is not so aboue , There is no shuffling , there the Action lyes In his true Nature , and we our selues compell'd Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults , To giue in euidence . *stop*
What then ? *stop*
What rests ? *stop*
Try what Repentance can . *stop*
What can it not ? *stop*
Yet what can it , when one can not repent ? *stop*
Oh wretched state ! *stop*
Oh bosome , blacke as death ! *stop*
Oh limed soule , that strugling to be free , Art more ingag 'd : Helpe Angels , make assay : Bow stubborne knees , and heart with strings of Steele , Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe , All may be well . *stop*
Enter Hamlet . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Now might I do it pat , now he is praying , And now Ile doo't , and so he goes to Heauen , And so am I reueng 'd : that would be scann 'd , A Villaine killes my Father , and for that I his foule Sonne , do this same Villaine send To heauen . *stop*
Oh this is hyre and Sallery , not Reuenge . *stop*
He tooke my Father grossely , full of bread , With all his Crimes broad blowne , as fresh as May , And how his Audit stands , who knowes , saue Heauen : But in our circumstance and course of thought 'Tis heauie with him : and am I then reueng 'd , To take him in the purging of his Soule , When he is fit and season 'd for his passage ? *stop*
No . *stop*
Vp Sword , and know thou a more horrid hent When he is drunke asleepe : or in his Rage , Or in th ' incestuous pleasure of his bed , At gaming , swearing , or about some acte That ha 's no rellish of Saluation i n't , Then trip him , that his heeles may kicke at Heauen , And that his Soule may be as damn 'd and blacke As Hell , whereto it goes . *stop*
My Mother stayes , This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes . *stop*
Enter . *stop*

My words flye vp , my thoughts remain below , Words without thoughts , neuer to Heauen go . *stop*

Hamlet , thou hast thy Father much offended Ham . *stop*
Mother , you haue my Father much offended Qu . *stop*
Come , come , you answer with an idle tongue Ham . *stop*
Go , go , you question with an idle tongue Qu . *stop*
Why how now Hamlet ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Whats the matter now ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
Haue you forgot me ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
No by the Rood , not so : You are the Queene , your Husbands Brothers wife , But would you were not so . *stop*
You are my Mother Qu . *stop*
Nay , then Ile set those to you that can speake Ham . *stop*
Come , come , and sit you downe , you shall not boudge : You go not till I set you vp a glasse , Where you may see the inmost part of you ? *stop*

Oh me , what hast thou done ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Nay I know not , is it the King ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
Oh what a rash , and bloody deed is this ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
A bloody deed , almost as bad good Mother , As kill a King , and marrie with his Brother Qu . *stop*
As kill a King ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I Lady , 't was my word . *stop*
Thou wretched , rash , intruding foole farewell , I tooke thee for thy Betters , take thy Fortune , Thou find'st to be too busie , is some danger . *stop*
Leaue wringing of your hands , peace , sit you downe , And let me wring your heart , for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuffe ; If damned Custome haue not braz 'd it so , That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense Qu . *stop*
What haue I done , that thou dar'st wag thy tong , In noise so rude against me ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Such an Act That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie , Cals Vertue Hypocrite , takes off the Rose From the faire forehead of an innocent loue , And makes a blister there . *stop*
Makes marriage vowes As false as Dicers Oathes . *stop*
Oh such a deed , As from the body of Contraction pluckes The very soule , and sweete Religion makes A rapsidie of words . *stop*
Heauens face doth glow , Yea this solidity and compound masse , With tristfull visage as against the doome , Is thought-sicke at the act Qu . *stop*
Aye me ; what act , that roares so lowd , & thunders in the Index Ham . *stop*
Looke heere vpon this Picture , and on this , The counterfet presentment of two Brothers : See what a grace was seated on his Brow , Hyperions curles , the front of Ioue himselfe , An eye like Mars , to threaten or command A Station , like the Herald Mercurie New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill : A Combination , and a forme indeed , Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale , To giue the world assurance of a man . *stop*
This was your Husband . *stop*
Looke you now what followes . *stop*
Heere is your Husband , like a Mildew 'd eare Blasting his wholsom breath . *stop*
Haue you eyes ? *stop*
Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed , And batten on this Moore ? *stop*
Ha ? *stop*
Haue you eyes ? *stop*
You can not call it Loue : For at your age , The hey-day in the blood is tame , it 's humble , And waites vpon the Iudgement : and what Iudgement Would step from this , to this ? *stop*
What diuell was't , That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde ? *stop*
O Shame ! *stop*
where is thy Blush ? *stop*
Rebellious Hell , If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones , To flaming youth , let Vertue be as waxe . *stop*
And melt in her owne fire . *stop*
Proclaime no shame , When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge , Since Frost it selfe , as actiuely doth burne , As Reason panders Will Qu . *stop*
O Hamlet , speake no more . *stop*
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule , And there I see such blacke and grained spots , As will not leaue their Tinct Ham . *stop*
Nay , but to liue In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed , Stew 'd in Corruption ; honying and making loue Ouer the nasty Stye Qu . *stop*
Oh speake to me , no more , These words like Daggers enter in mine eares . *stop*
No more sweet Hamlet Ham . *stop*
A Murderer , and a Villaine : A Slaue , that is not twentieth part the tythe Of your precedent Lord . *stop*
A vice of Kings , A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule . *stop*
That from a shelfe , the precious Diadem stole , And put it in his Pocket Qu . *stop*
No more . *stop*
Enter Ghost . *stop*

Saue me ; and houer o 're me with your wings You heauenly Guards . *stop*

Alas he 's mad Ham . *stop*
Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide , That laps't in Time and Passion , lets go by Th ' important acting of your dread command ? *stop*
Oh say Ghost . *stop*
Do not forget : this Visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose . *stop*
But looke , Amazement on thy Mother sits ; O step betweene her , and her fighting Soule , Conceit in weakest bodies , strongest workes . *stop*
Speake to her Hamlet Ham . *stop*
How is it with you Lady ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
Alas , how is't with you ? *stop*
That you bend your eye on vacancie , And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse . *stop*
Forth at your eyes , your spirits wildely peepe , And as the sleeping Soldiours in th ' Alarme , Your bedded haire , like life in excrements , Start vp , and stand an end . *stop*
Oh gentle Sonne , Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle coole patience . *stop*
Whereon do you looke ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
On him , on him : look you how pale he glares , His forme and cause conioyn 'd , preaching to stones , Would make them capeable . *stop*
Do not looke vpon me , Least with this pitteous action you conuert My sterne effects : then what I haue to do , Will want true colour ; teares perchance for blood Qu . *stop*
To who do you speake this ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Do you see nothing there ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
Nothing at all , yet all that is I see Ham . *stop*
Nor did you nothing heare ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
No , nothing but our selues Ham . *stop*
Why look you there : looke how it steals away : My Father in his habite , as he liued , Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Qu . *stop*
This is the very coynage of your Braine , This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in Ham . *stop*
Extasie ? *stop*
My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time , And makes as healthfull Musicke . *stop*
It is not madnesse That I haue vttered ; bring me to the Test And I the matter will re-word : which madnesse Would gamboll from . *stop*
Mother , for loue of Grace , Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule , That not your trespasse , but my madnesse speakes : It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place , Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within , Infects vnseene . *stop*
Confesse your selfe to Heauen , Repent what 's past , auoyd what is to come , And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes , To make them ranke . *stop*
Forgiue me this my Vertue , For in the fatnesse of this pursie times , Vertue it selfe , of Vice must pardon begge , Yea courb , and woe , for leaue to do him good Qu . *stop*
Oh Hamlet , Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine Ham . *stop*
O throw away the worser part of it , And liue the purer with the other halfe . *stop*
Good night , but go not to mine Vnkles bed , Assume a Vertue , if you haue it not , refraine to night , And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse To the next abstinence . *stop*
Once more goodnight , And when you are desirous to be blest , Ile blessing begge of you . *stop*
For this same Lord , I do repent : but heauen hath pleas 'd it so , To punish me with this , and this with me , That I must be their Scourge and Minister . *stop*
I will bestow him , and will answer well The death I gaue him : so againe , good night . *stop*
I must be cruell , onely to be kinde ; Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde Qu . *stop*
What shall I do ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Not this by no meanes that I bid you do : Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed , Pinch Wanton on your cheeke , call you his Mouse , And let him for a paire of reechie kisses , Or padling in your necke with his damn 'd Fingers , Make you to rauell all this matter out , That I essentially am not in madnesse , But made in craft . *stop*
'Twere good you let him know , For who that 's but a Queene , faire , sober , wise , Would from a Paddocke , from a Bat , a Gibbe , Such deere concernings hide , Who would do so , No in despight of Sense and Secrecie , Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top : Let the Birds flye , and like the famous Ape To try Conclusions in the Basket , creepe And breake your owne necke downe Qu . *stop*
Be thou assur 'd , if words be made of breath , And breath of life : I haue no life to breath What thou hast saide to me Ham . *stop*
I must to England , you know that ? *stop*

Alacke I had forgot : 'T is so concluded on Ham . *stop*
This man shall set me packing : Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome , Mother goodnight . *stop*
Indeede this Counsellor Is now most still , most secret , and most graue , Who was in life , a foolish prating Knaue . *stop*
Come sir , to draw toward an end with you . *stop*
Good night Mother . *stop*

Mad as the Seas , and winde , when both contend Which is the Mightier , in his lawlesse fit Behinde the Arras , hearing something stirre , He whips his Rapier out , and cries a Rat , a Rat , And in his brainish apprehension killes The vnseene good old man King . *stop*
Oh heauy deed : It had bin so with vs had we beene there : His Liberty is full of threats to all , To you your selfe , to vs , to euery one . *stop*
Alas , how shall this bloody deede be answered ? *stop*
It will be laide to vs , whose prouidence Should haue kept short , restrain 'd , and out of haunt , This mad yong man . *stop*
But so much was our loue , We would not vnderstand what was most fit , But like the Owner of a foule disease , To keepe it from divulging , let 's it feede Euen on the pith of life . *stop*
Where is he gone ? *stop*
Qu . *stop*
To draw apart the body he hath kild , O 're whom his very madnesse like some Oare Among a Minerall of Mettels base Shewes it selfe pure . *stop*
He weepes for what is done King . *stop*
Oh Gertrude , come away : The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch , But we will ship him hence , and this vilde deed , We must with all our Maiesty and Skill Both countenance , and excuse . *stop*
Enter Ros . *stop*

Besides , to be demanded of a Spundge , what replication should be made by the Sonne of a King Rosin . *stop*
Take you me for a Spundge , my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I sir , that sokes vp the Kings Countenance , his Rewards , his Authorities ( but such Officers do the King best seruice in the end . *stop*
He keepes them like an Ape in the corner of his iaw , first mouth 'd to be last swallowed , when he needes what you haue glean 'd , it is but squeezing you , and Spundge you shall be dry againe Rosin . *stop*
I vnderstand you not my Lord Ham . *stop*
I am glad of it : a knauish speech sleepes in a foolish eare Rosin . *stop*
My Lord , you must tell vs where the body is , and go with vs to the King Ham . *stop*

I haue sent to seeke him , and to find the bodie : How dangerous is it that this man goes loose : Yet must not we put the strong Law on him : Hee 's loued of the distracted multitude , Who like not in their iudgement , but their eyes : And where 't is so , th ' Offenders scourge is weigh'd But neerer the offence : to beare all smooth , and euen , This sodaine sending him away , must seeme Deliberate pause , diseases desperate growne , By desperate appliance are releeued , Or not at all . *stop*

At Supper ? *stop*
Where ? *stop*

Not where he eats , but where he is eaten , a certaine conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him . *stop*
Your worm is your onely Emperor for diet . *stop*
We fat all creatures else to fat vs , and we fat our selfe for Magots . *stop*
Your fat King , and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes , but to one Table that 's the end King . *stop*
What dost thou meane by this ? *stop*

Away , for euery thing is Seal 'd and done That else leanes on th ' Affaire , pray you make hast . *stop*
And England , if my loue thou holdst at ought , As my great power thereof may giue thee sense , Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red After the Danish Sword , and thy free awe Payes homage to vs ; thou maist not coldly set Our Soueraigne Processe , which imports at full By Letters coniuring to that effect The present death of Hamlet . *stop*
Do it England , For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages , And thou must cure me : Till I know 't is done , How ere my happes , my ioyes were ne 're begun . *stop*

She is importunate , indeed distract , her moode will needs be pittied Qu . *stop*
What would she haue ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
She speakes much of her Father ; saies she heares There 's trickes i'th ' world , and hems , and beats her heart , Spurnes enuiously at Strawes , speakes things in doubt , That carry but halfe sense : Her speech is nothing , Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue The hearers to Collection ; they ayme at it , And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts , Which as her winkes , and nods , and gestures yeeld them , Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought , Though nothing sure , yet much vnhappily Qu . *stop*
'Twere good she were spoken with , For she may strew dangerous coniectures In ill breeding minds . *stop*
Let her come in . *stop*
To my sicke soule ( as sinnes true Nature is ) Each toy seemes Prologue , to some great amisse , So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt , It spill 's it selfe , in fearing to be spilt . *stop*

How long hath she bin thus ? *stop*

Oh Gertrude , Gertrude , When sorrowes comes , they come not single spies , But in Battalians . *stop*
First , her Father slaine , Next your Sonne gone , and he most violent Author Of his owne iust remoue : the people muddied , Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts , and whispers For good Polonius death ; and we haue done but greenly In hugger mugger to interre him . *stop*
Poore Ophelia Diuided from her selfe , and her faire Iudgement , Without the which we are Pictures , or meere Beasts . *stop*
Last , and as much containing as all these , Her Brother is in secret come from France , Keepes on his wonder , keepes himselfe in clouds , And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death , Where in necessitie of matter Beggard , Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne In eare and eare . *stop*
O my deere Gertrude , this , Like to a murdering Peece in many places , Giues me superfluous death . *stop*

What is the cause Laertes , That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like ? *stop*
Let him go Gertrude : Do not feare our person : There 's such Diuinity doth hedge a King , That Treason can but peepe to what it would , Acts little of his will . *stop*
Tell me Laertes , Why thou art thus Incenst ? *stop*
Let him go Gertrude . *stop*
Speake man Laer . *stop*

None but his Enemies King . *stop*
Will you know them then La . *stop*
To his good Friends , thus wide Ile ope my Armes : And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician , Repast them with my blood King . *stop*
Why now you speake Like a good Childe , and a true Gentleman . *stop*
That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death , And am most sensible in greefe for it , It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce As day do 's to your eye . *stop*
A noise within . *stop*
Let her come in . *stop*
Enter Ophelia . *stop*
Laer . *stop*
How now ? *stop*
what noise is that ? *stop*
Oh heate drie vp my Braines , teares seuen times salt , Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye . *stop*
By Heauen , thy madnesse shall be payed by waight , Till our Scale turnes the beame . *stop*
Oh Rose of May , Deere Maid , kinde Sister , sweet Ophelia : Oh Heauens , is't possible , a yong Maids wits , Should be as mortall as an old mans life ? *stop*
Nature is fine in Loue , and where 't is fine , It sends some precious instance of it selfe After the thing it loues Ophe . *stop*
They bore him bare fac 'd on the Beer , Hey non nony , nony , hey nony : And on his graue raines many a teare , Fare you well my Doue Laer . *stop*
Had'st thou thy wits , and did'st perswade Reuenge , it could not moue thus Ophe . *stop*
You must sing downe a-downe , and you call him a-downe-a . *stop*
Oh , how the wheele becomes it ? *stop*
It is the false Steward that stole his masters daughter Laer . *stop*
This nothings more then matter Ophe . *stop*
There 's Rosemary , that 's for Remembraunce . *stop*
Pray loue remember : and there is Paconcies , that 's for Thoughts Laer . *stop*
A document in madnesse , thoughts & remembrance fitted Ophe . *stop*
There 's Fennell for you , and Columbines : ther's Rew for you , and heere 's some for me . *stop*
Wee may call it Herbe-Grace a Sundaies : Oh you must weare your Rew with a difference . *stop*
There 's a Daysie , I would giue you some Violets , but they wither 'd all when my Father dyed : They say , he made a good end ; For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy Laer . *stop*
Thought , and Affliction , Passion , Hell it selfe : She turnes to Fauour , and to prettinesse Ophe . *stop*
And will he not come againe , And will he not come againe : No , no , he is dead , go to thy Death-bed , He neuer wil come againe . *stop*
His Beard as white as Snow , All Flaxen was his Pole : He is gone , he is gone , and we cast away mone , Gramercy on his Soule . *stop*
And of all Christian Soules , I pray God . *stop*
God buy ye . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Ophelia Laer . *stop*
Do you see this , you Gods ? *stop*
King . *stop*
Laertes , I must common with your greefe , Or you deny me right : go but apart , Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will , And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me ; If by direct or by Colaterall hand They finde vs touch 'd , we will our Kingdome giue , Our Crowne , our Life , and all that we call Ours To you in satisfaction . *stop*
But if not , Be you content to lend your patience to vs , And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule To giue it due content Laer . *stop*
Let this be so : His meanes of death , his obscure buriall ; No Trophee , Sword , nor Hatchment o 're his bones , No Noble rite , nor formall ostentation , Cry to be heard , as 'twere from Heauen to Earth , That I must call in question King . *stop*
So you shall : And where th ' offence is , let the great Axe fall . *stop*
I pray you go with me . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter Horatio , with an Attendant . *stop*
Hora . *stop*
What are they that would speake with me ? *stop*
Ser . *stop*
Saylors sir , they say they haue Letters for you Hor . *stop*
Let them come in , I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted , if not from Lord Hamlet . *stop*
Enter Saylor . *stop*
Say . *stop*
God blesse you Sir Hor . *stop*
Let him blesse thee too Say . *stop*
Hee shall Sir , and't please him . *stop*
There 's a Letter for you Sir : It comes from th ' Ambassadours that was bound for England , if your name be Horatio , as I am let to know it is . *stop*
Reads the Letter . *stop*
Horatio , When thou shalt haue ouerlook 'd this , giue these Fellowes some meanes to the King : They haue Letters for him . *stop*
Ere we were two dayes old at Sea , a Pyrate of very Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace . *stop*
Finding our selues too slow of Saile , we put on a compelled Valour . *stop*
In the Grapple , I boorded them : On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe , so I alone became their Prisoner . *stop*
They haue dealt with mee , like Theeues of Mercy , but they knew what they did . *stop*
I am to doe a good turne for them . *stop*
Let the King haue the Letters I haue sent , and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest flye death . *stop*
I haue words to speake in your eare , will make thee dumbe , yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter . *stop*
These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am . *stop*
Rosincrance and Guildensterne , hold their course for England . *stop*
Of them I haue much to tell thee , Farewell . *stop*
He that thou knowest thine , Hamlet . *stop*
Come , I will giue you way for these your Letters , And do't the speedier , that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Enter King and Laertes . *stop*
King . *stop*
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal , And you must put me in your heart for Friend , Sith you haue heard , and with a knowing eare , That he which hath your Noble Father slaine , Pursued my life Laer . *stop*
It well appeares . *stop*
But tell me , Why you proceeded not against these feates , So crimefull , and so Capitall in Nature , As by your Safety , Wisedome , all things else , You mainly were stirr 'd vp ? *stop*
King . *stop*
O for two speciall Reasons , Which may to you ( perhaps ) seeme much vnsinnowed , And yet to me they are strong . *stop*
The Queen his Mother , Liues almost by his lookes : and for my selfe , My Vertue or my Plague , be it either which , She 's so coniunctiue to my life , and soule ; That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere , I could not but by her . *stop*
The other Motiue , Why to a publike count I might not go , Is the great loue the generall gender beare him , Who dipping all his Faults in their affection , Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone , Conuert his Gyues to Graces . *stop*
So that my Arrowes Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde , Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe , And not where I had arm 'd them Laer . *stop*
And so haue I a Noble Father lost , A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes , Who was ( if praises may go backe againe ) Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age For her perfections . *stop*
But my reuenge will come King . *stop*
Breake not your sleepes for that , You must not thinke That we are made of stuffe , so flat , and dull , That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger , And thinke it pastime . *stop*
You shortly shall heare more , I lou 'd your Father , and we loue our Selfe , And that I hope will teach you to imagine- Enter a Messenger . *stop*
How now ? *stop*
What Newes ? *stop*
Mes . *stop*
Letters my Lord from Hamlet , This to your Maiesty : this to the Queene King . *stop*
From Hamlet ? *stop*
Who brought them ? *stop*
Mes . *stop*
Saylors my Lord they say , I saw them not : They were giuen me by Claudio , he receiu 'd them King . *stop*
Laertes you shall heare them : Leaue vs. Exit Messenger High and Mighty , you shall know I am set naked on your Kingdome . *stop*
To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly Eyes . *stop*
When I shall ( first asking your Pardon thereunto ) recount th ' Occasions of my sodaine , and more strange returne . *stop*
Hamlet . *stop*
What should this meane ? *stop*
Are all the rest come backe ? *stop*
Or is it some abuse ? *stop*
Or no such thing ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
Know you the hand ? *stop*
Kin . *stop*
'T is Hamlets Character , naked and in a Postscript here he sayes alone : Can you aduise me ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
I 'm lost in it my Lord ; but let him come , It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart , That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth ; Thus diddest thou Kin . *stop*
If it be so Laertes , as how should it be so : How otherwise will you be rul 'd by me ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
If so you ' l not o'rerule me to a peace Kin . *stop*
To thine owne peace : if he be now return 'd , As checking at his Voyage , and that he meanes No more to vndertake it ; I will worke him To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice , Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall ; And for his death no winde of blame shall breath , But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice , And call it accident : Some two Monthes hence Here was a Gentleman of Normandy , I'ue seene my selfe , and seru 'd against the French , And they ran well on Horsebacke ; but this Gallant Had witchcraft i n't ; he grew into his Seat , And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse , As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd With the braue Beast , so farre he past my thought , That I in forgery of shapes and trickes , Come short of what he did Laer . *stop*
A Norman was't ? *stop*
Kin . *stop*
A Norman Laer . *stop*
Vpon my life Lamound Kin . *stop*
The very same Laer . *stop*
I know him well , he is the Brooch indeed , And Iemme of all our Nation Kin . *stop*
Hee mad confession of you , And gaue you such a Masterly report , For Art and exercise in your defence ; And for your Rapier most especiall , That he cryed out , t'would be a sight indeed , If one could match you Sir . *stop*
This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy , That he could nothing doe but wish and begge , Your sodaine comming ore to play with him ; Now out of this Laer . *stop*
Why out of this , my Lord ? *stop*
Kin . *stop*
Laertes was your Father deare to you ? *stop*
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
Why aske you this ? *stop*
Kin . *stop*
Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father , But that I know Loue is begun by Time : And that I see in passages of proofe , Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it : Hamlet comes backe : what would you vndertake , To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed , More then in words ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
To cut his throat i'th ' Church Kin . *stop*
No place indeed should murder Sancturize ; Reuenge should haue no bounds : but good Laertes Will you doe this , keepe close within your Chamber , Hamlet return 'd , shall know you are come home : Wee ' l put on those shall praise your excellence , And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gaue you , bring you in fine together , And wager on your heads , he being remisse , Most generous , and free from all contriuing , Will not peruse the Foiles ? *stop*
So that with ease , Or with a little shuffling , you may choose A Sword vnbaited , and in a passe of practice , Requit him for your Father Laer . *stop*
I will doo't . *stop*
And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword : I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke So mortall , I but dipt a knife in it , Where it drawes blood , no Cataplasme so rare , Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue Vnder the Moone , can saue the thing from death , That is but scratcht withall : Ile touch my point , With this contagion , that if I gall him slightly , It may be death Kin . *stop*
Let 's further thinke of this , Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes May fit vs to our shape , if this should faile ; And that our drift looke through our bad performance , 'Twere better not assaid ; therefore this Proiect Should haue a backe or second , that might hold , If this should blast in proofe : Soft , let me see Wee ' l make a solemne wager on your commings , I ha't : when in your motion you are hot and dry , As make your bowts more violent to the end , And that he cals for drinke ; Ile haue prepar 'd him A Challice for the nonce ; whereon but sipping , If he by chance escape your venom 'd stuck , Our purpose may hold there ; how sweet Queene . *stop*
Enter Queene . *stop*
Queen . *stop*
One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele , So fast they ' l follow : your Sister 's drown 'd Laertes Laer . *stop*
Drown 'd ! *stop*
O where ? *stop*
Queen . *stop*
There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke , That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame : There with fantasticke Garlands did she come , Of Crow-flowers , Nettles , Daysies , and long Purples , That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name ; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them : There on the pendant boughes , her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang ; an enuious sliuer broke , When downe the weedy Trophies , and her selfe , Fell in the weeping Brooke , her cloathes spred wide , And Mermaid-like , a while they bore her vp , Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes , As one incapable of her owne distresse , Or like a creature Natiue , and indued Vnto that Element : but long it could not be , Till that her garments , heauy with her drinke , Pul 'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy , To muddy death Laer . *stop*
Alas then , is she drown 'd ? *stop*
Queen . *stop*
Drown 'd , drown'd Laer . *stop*
Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia , And therefore I forbid my teares : but yet It is our tricke , Nature her custome holds , Let shame say what it will ; when these are gone The woman will be out : Adue my Lord , I haue a speech of fire , that faine would blaze , But that this folly doubts it . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Kin . *stop*
Let 's follow , Gertrude : How much I had to doe to calme his rage ? *stop*
Now feare I this will giue it start againe ; Therefore let 's follow . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter two Clownes . *stop*
Clown . *stop*
Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall , that wilfully seekes her owne saluation ? *stop*
Other . *stop*
I tell thee she is , and therefore make her Graue straight , the Crowner hath sate on her , and finds it Christian buriall Clo . *stop*
How can that be , vnlesse she drowned her selfe in her owne defence ? *stop*
Other . *stop*
Why 't is found so Clo . *stop*
It must be Se offendendo , it can not bee else : for heere lies the point ; If I drowne my selfe wittingly , it argues an Act : and an Act hath three branches . *stop*
It is an Act to doe and to performe ; argall she drown 'd her selfe wittingly Other . *stop*
Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer Clown . *stop*
Giue me leaue ; heere lies the water ; good : heere stands the man ; good : If the man goe to this water and drowne himselfe ; it is will he nill he , he goes ; marke you that ? *stop*
But if the water come to him & drowne him ; hee drownes not himselfe . *stop*
Argall , hee that is not guilty of his owne death , shortens not his owne life Other . *stop*
But is this law ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
I marry is't , Crowners Quest Law Other . *stop*
Will you ha the truth o n't : if this had not beene a Gentlewoman , shee should haue beene buried out of Christian Buriall Clo . *stop*
Why there thou say'st . *stop*
And the more pitty that great folke should haue countenance in this world to drowne or hang themselues , more then their euen Christian . *stop*
Come , my Spade ; there is no ancient Gentlemen , but Gardiners , Ditchers and Graue-makers ; they hold vp Adams Profession Other . *stop*
Was he a Gentleman ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
He was the first that euer bore Armes Other . *stop*
Why he had none Clo . *stop*
What , ar't a Heathen ? *stop*
how doth thou vnderstand the Scripture ? *stop*
the Scripture sayes Adam dig 'd ; could hee digge without Armes ? *stop*
Ile put another question to thee ; if thou answerest me not to the purpose , confesse thy selfe- Other . *stop*
Go too Clo . *stop*
What is he that builds stronger then either the Mason , the Shipwright , or the Carpenter ? *stop*
Other . *stop*
The Gallowes maker ; for that Frame outliues a thousand Tenants Clo . *stop*
I like thy wit well in good faith , the Gallowes does well ; but how does it well ? *stop*
it does well to those that doe ill : now , thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is built stronger then the Church : Argall , the Gallowes may doe well to thee . *stop*
Too't againe , Come Other . *stop*
Who builds stronger then a Mason , a Shipwright , or a Carpenter ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
I , tell me that , and vnyoake Other . *stop*
Marry , now I can tell Clo . *stop*
Too't Other . *stop*
Masse , I can not tell . *stop*
Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off . *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Cudgell thy braines no more about it ; for your dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating ; and when you are ask't this question next , say a Graue-maker : the Houses that he makes , lasts till Doomesday : go , get thee to Yaughan , fetch me a stoupe of Liquor . *stop*
Sings . *stop*
In youth when I did loue , did loue , me thought it was very sweete : To contract O the time for a my behoue , O me thought there was nothing meete Ham . *stop*
Ha 's this fellow no feeling of his businesse , that he sings at Graue-making ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse Ham . *stop*
'T is ee ' n so ; the hand of little Imployment hath the daintier sense Clowne sings . *stop*
But Age with his stealing steps hath caught me in his clutch : And hath shipped me intill the Land , as if I had neuer beene such Ham . *stop*
That Scull had a tongue in it , and could sing once : how the knaue iowles it to th ' grownd , as if it were Caines Iaw-bone , that did the first murther : It might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o 're Offices : one that could circumuent God , might it not ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
It might , my Lord Ham . *stop*
Or of a Courtier , which could say , Good Morrow sweet Lord : how dost thou , good Lord ? *stop*
this might be my Lord such a one , that prais 'd my Lord such a ones Horse , when he meant to begge it ; might it not ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
I , my Lord Ham . *stop*
Why ee ' n so : and now my Lady Wormes , Chaplesse , and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons Spade ; heere 's fine Reuolution , if wee had the tricke to see't . *stop*
Did these bones cost no more the breeding , but to play at Loggets with 'em ? *stop*
mine ake to thinke on't Clowne sings . *stop*
A Pickhaxe and a Spade , a Spade , for and a shrowding-Sheete : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete Ham . *stop*
There 's another : why might not that bee the Scull of a Lawyer ? *stop*
where be his Quiddits now ? *stop*
his Quillets ? *stop*
his Cases ? *stop*
his Tenures , and his Tricks ? *stop*
why doe 's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about the Sconce with a dirty Shouell , and will not tell him of his Action of Battery ? *stop*
hum . *stop*
This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of Land , with his Statutes , his Recognizances , his Fines , his double Vouchers , his Recoueries : Is this the fine of his Fines , and the recouery of his Recoueries , to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt ? *stop*
will his Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases , and double ones too , then the length and breadth of a paire of Indentures ? *stop*
the very Conueyances of his Lands will hardly lye in this Boxe ; and must the Inheritor himselfe haue no more ? *stop*
ha ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Not a iot more , my Lord Ham . *stop*
Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
I my Lord , and of Calue-skinnes too Ham . *stop*
They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance in that . *stop*
I will speake to this fellow : whose Graue's this Sir ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Mine Sir : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete Ham . *stop*
I thinke it be thine indeed : for thou liest in't Clo . *stop*
You lye out o n't Sir , and therefore it is not yours : for my part , I doe not lye i n't ; and yet it is mine Ham . *stop*
Thou dost lye i n't , to be i n't and say 't is thine : 'tis for the dead , not for the quicke , therefore thou lyest Clo . *stop*
'T is a quicke lye Sir , 'twill away againe from me to you Ham . *stop*
What man dost thou digge it for ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
For no man Sir Ham . *stop*
What woman then ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
For none neither Ham . *stop*
Who is to be buried i n't ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
One that was a woman Sir ; but rest her Soule , shee 's dead Ham . *stop*
How absolute the knaue is ? *stop*
wee must speake by the Carde , or equiuocation will vndoe vs : by the Lord Horatio , these three yeares I haue taken note of it , the Age is growne so picked , that the toe of the Pesant comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier , hee galls his Kibe . *stop*
How long hast thou been a Graue-maker ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Of all the dayes i'th ' yeare , I came too't that day that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras Ham . *stop*
How long is that since ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Can not you tell that ? *stop*
euery foole can tell that : It was the very day , that young Hamlet was borne , hee that was mad , and sent into England Ham . *stop*
I marry , why was he sent into England ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Why , because he was mad ; hee shall recouer his wits there ; or if he do not , it 's no great matter there Ham . *stop*
Why ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
'Twill not be seene in him , there the men are as mad as he Ham . *stop*
How came he mad ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Very strangely they say Ham . *stop*
How strangely ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Faith e'ene with loosing his wits Ham . *stop*
Vpon what ground ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Why heere in Denmarke : I haue bin sixeteene heere , man and Boy thirty yeares Ham . *stop*
How long will a man lie i'th ' earth ere he rot ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Ifaith , if he be not rotten before he die ( as we haue many pocky Coarses now adaies , that will scarce hold the laying in ) he will last you some eight yeare , or nine yeare . *stop*
A Tanner will last you nine yeare Ham . *stop*
Why he , more then another ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
Why sir , his hide is so tan 'd with his Trade , that he will keepe out water a great while . *stop*
And your water , is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body . *stop*
Heres a Scull now : this Scul , has laine in the earth three & twenty years Ham . *stop*
Whose was it ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
A whoreson mad Fellowes it was ; Whose doe you thinke it was ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Nay , I know not Clo . *stop*
A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue , a pour 'd a Flaggon of Renish on my head once . *stop*
This same Scull Sir , this same Scull sir , was Yoricks Scull , the Kings Iester Ham . *stop*
This ? *stop*
Clo . *stop*
E'ene that Ham . *stop*
Let me see . *stop*
Alas poore Yorick , I knew him Horatio , a fellow of infinite Iest ; of most excellent fancy , he hath borne me on his backe a thousand times : And how abhorred my Imagination is , my gorge rises at it . *stop*
Heere hung those lipps , that I haue kist I know not how oft . *stop*
Where be your Iibes now ? *stop*
Your Gambals ? *stop*
Your Songs ? *stop*
Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table on a Rore ? *stop*
No one now to mock your own Ieering ? *stop*
Quite chopfalne ? *stop*
Now get you to my Ladies Chamber , and tell her , let her paint an inch thicke , to this fauour she must come . *stop*
Make her laugh at that : prythee Horatio tell me one thing Hor . *stop*
What 's that my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion i'th ' earth ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
E'ene so Ham . *stop*
And smelt so ? *stop*
Puh Hor . *stop*
E'ene so , my Lord Ham . *stop*
To what base vses we may returne Horatio . *stop*
Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander , till he find it stopping a bunghole Hor . *stop*
'Twere to consider : to curiously to consider so Ham . *stop*
No faith , not a iot . *stop*
But to follow him thether with modestie enough , & likeliehood to lead it ; as thus . *stop*
Alexander died : Alexander was buried : Alexander returneth into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make Lome , and why of that Lome ( whereto he was conuerted ) might they not stopp a Beere-barrell ? *stop*
Imperiall Caesar , dead and turn 'd to clay , Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away . *stop*
Oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , Should patch a Wall , t ' expell the winters flaw . *stop*
But soft , but soft , aside ; heere comes the King . *stop*
Enter King , Queene , Laertes , and a Coffin , with Lords attendant . *stop*
The Queene , the Courtiers . *stop*
Who is that they follow , And with such maimed rites ? *stop*
This doth betoken , The Coarse they follow , did with disperate hand , Fore do it owne life ; 't was some Estate . *stop*
Couch we a while , and mark Laer . *stop*
What Cerimony else ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
That is Laertes , a very Noble youth : Marke Laer . *stop*
What Cerimony else ? *stop*
Priest . *stop*
Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg 'd . *stop*
As we haue warrantie , her death was doubtfull , And but that great Command , o're-swaies the order , She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg 'd , Till the last Trumpet . *stop*
For charitable praier , Shardes , Flints , and Peebles , should be throwne on her : Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites , Her Maiden strewments , and the bringing home Of Bell and Buriall Laer . *stop*
Must there no more be done ? *stop*
Priest . *stop*
No more be done : We should prophane the seruice of the dead , To sing sage Requiem , and such rest to her As to peace-parted Soules Laer . *stop*
Lay her i'th ' earth , And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh , May Violets spring . *stop*
I tell thee ( churlish Priest ) A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be , When thou liest howling ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
What , the faire Ophelia ? *stop*
Queene . *stop*
Sweets , to the sweet farewell . *stop*
I hop 'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife : I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt ( sweet Maid ) And not t'haue strew 'd thy Graue Laer . *stop*
Oh terrible woer , Fall ten times trebble , on that cursed head Whose wicked deed , thy most Ingenious sence Depriu 'd thee of . *stop*
Hold off the earth a while , Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes : Leaps in the graue . *stop*
Now pile your dust , vpon the quicke , and dead , Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made , To o 're top old Pelion , or the skyish head Of blew Olympus Ham . *stop*
What is he , whose griefes Beares such an Emphasis ? *stop*
whose phrase of Sorrow Coniure the wandring Starres , and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers ? *stop*
This is I , Hamlet the Dane Laer . *stop*
The deuill take thy soule Ham . *stop*
Thou prai'st not well , I prythee take thy fingers from my throat ; Sir though I am not Spleenatiue , and rash , Yet haue I something in me dangerous , Which let thy wisenesse feare . *stop*
Away thy hand King . *stop*
Pluck them asunder Qu . *stop*
Hamlet , Hamlet Gen. Good my Lord be quiet Ham . *stop*
Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme . *stop*
Vntill my eielids will no longer wag Qu . *stop*
Oh my Sonne , what Theame ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
I lou 'd Ophelia ; fortie thousand Brothers Could not ( with all there quantitie of Loue ) Make vp my summe . *stop*
What wilt thou do for her ? *stop*
King . *stop*
Oh he is mad Laertes , Qu . *stop*
For loue of God forbeare him Ham . *stop*
Come show me what thou'lt doe . *stop*
Woo't weepe ? *stop*
Woo't fight ? *stop*
Woo't teare thy selfe ? *stop*
Woo't drinke vp Esile , eate a Crocodile ? *stop*
Ile doo't . *stop*
Dost thou come heere to whine ; To outface me with leaping in her Graue ? *stop*
Be buried quicke with her , and so will I . *stop*
And if thou prate of Mountaines ; let them throw Millions of Akers on vs ; till our ground Sindging his pate against the burning Zone , Make Ossa like a wart . *stop*
Nay , and thou'lt mouth , Ile rant as well as thou Kin . *stop*
This is meere Madnesse : And thus awhile the fit will worke on him : Anon as patient as the female Doue , When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos 'd ; His silence will sit drooping Ham . *stop*
Heare you Sir : What is the reason that you vse me thus ? *stop*
I lou 'd you euer ; but it is no matter : Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may , The Cat will Mew , and Dogge will haue his day . *stop*
Enter . *stop*
Kin . *stop*
I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him , Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech , Wee ' l put the matter to the present push : Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne , This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument : An houre of quiet shortly shall we see ; Till then , in patience our proceeding be . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Enter Hamlet and Horatio Ham . *stop*
So much for this Sir ; now let me see the other , You doe remember all the Circumstance Hor . *stop*
Remember it my Lord ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Sir , in my heart there was a kinde of fighting , That would not let me sleepe ; me thought I lay Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes , rashly , ( And praise be rashnesse for it ) let vs know , Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well , When our deare plots do paule , and that should teach vs , There 's a Diuinity that shapes our ends , Rough-hew them how we will Hor . *stop*
That is most certaine Ham . *stop*
Vp from my Cabin My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke , Grop 'd I to finde out them ; had my desire , Finger 'd their Packet , and in fine , withdrew To mine owne roome againe , making so bold , ( My feares forgetting manners ) to vnseale Their grand Commission , where I found Horatio , Oh royall knauery : An exact command , Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason ; Importing Denmarks health , and Englands too , With hoo , such Bugges and Goblins in my life , That on the superuize no leasure bated , No not to stay the grinding of the Axe , My head should be struck off Hor . *stop*
Ist possible ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Here 's the Commission , read it at more leysure : But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
I beseech you Ham . *stop*
Being thus benetted round with Villaines , Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines , They had begun the Play . *stop*
I sate me downe , Deuis 'd a new Commission , wrote it faire , I once did hold it as our Statists doe , A basenesse to write faire ; and laboured much How to forget that learning : but Sir now , It did me Yeomans seriuce : wilt thou know The effects of what I wrote ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
I , good my Lord Ham . *stop*
An earnest Coniuration from the King , As England was his faithfull Tributary , As loue betweene them , as the Palme should flourish , As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare , And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities , And many such like Assis of great charge , That on the view and know of these Contents , Without debatement further , more or lesse , He should the bearers put to sodaine death , Not shriuing time allowed Hor . *stop*
How was this seal 'd ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Why , euen in that was Heauen ordinate ; I had my fathers Signet in my Purse , Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale : Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other , Subscrib 'd it , gau't th ' impression , plac't it safely , The changeling neuer knowne : Now , the next day Was our Sea Fight , and what to this was sement , Thou know'st already Hor . *stop*
So Guildensterne and Rosincrance , go too't Ham . *stop*
Why man , they did make loue to this imployment They are not neere my Conscience ; their debate Doth by their owne insinuation grow : 'Tis dangerous , when the baser nature comes Betweene the passe , and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites Hor . *stop*
Why , what a King is this ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Does it not , thinkst thee , stand me now vpon He that hath kil 'd my King , and whor 'd my Mother , Popt in betweene th ' election and my hopes , Throwne out his Angle for my proper life , And with such coozenage ; is't not perfect conscience , To quit him with this arme ? *stop*
And is't not to be damn'd To let this Canker of our nature come In further euill Hor . *stop*
It must be shortly knowne to him from England What is the issue of the businesse there Ham . *stop*
It will be short , The interim 's mine , and a mans life 's no more Then to say one : but I am very sorry good Horatio , That to Laertes I forgot my selfe ; For by the image of my Cause , I see The Portraiture of his ; Ile count his fauours : But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me Into a Towring passion Hor . *stop*
Peace , who comes heere ? *stop*
Enter young Osricke . *stop*
Osr . *stop*
Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke Ham . *stop*
I humbly thank you Sir , dost know this waterflie ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
No my good Lord Ham . *stop*
Thy state is the more gracious ; for 't is a vice to know him : he hath much Land , and fertile ; let a Beast be Lord of Beasts , and his Crib shall stand at the Kings Messe ; 't is a Chowgh ; but as I saw spacious in the possession of dirt Osr . *stop*
Sweet Lord , if your friendship were at leysure , I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty Ham . *stop*
I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit ; put your Bonet to his right vse , 't is for the head Osr . *stop*
I thanke your Lordship , 't is very hot Ham . *stop*
No , beleeue mee 't is very cold , the winde is Northerly Osr . *stop*
It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed Ham . *stop*
Mee thinkes it is very soultry , and hot for my Complexion Osr . *stop*
Exceedingly , my Lord , it is very soultry , as 'twere I can not tell how : but my Lord , his Maiesty bad me signifie to you , that he ha 's laid a great wager on your head : Sir , this is the matter Ham . *stop*
I beseech you remember Osr . *stop*
Nay , in good faith , for mine ease in good faith : Sir , you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at his weapon Ham . *stop*
What 's his weapon ? *stop*
Osr . *stop*
Rapier and dagger Ham . *stop*
That 's two of his weapons ; but well Osr . *stop*
The sir King ha 's wag 'd with him six Barbary horses , against the which he impon 'd as I take it , sixe French Rapiers and Poniards , with their assignes , as Girdle , Hangers or so : three of the Carriages infaith are very deare to fancy , very responsiue to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberall conceit Ham . *stop*
What call you the Carriages ? *stop*
Osr . *stop*
The Carriages Sir , are the hangers Ham . *stop*
The phrase would bee more Germaine to the matter : If we could carry Cannon by our sides ; I would it might be Hangers till then ; but on sixe Barbary Horses against sixe French Swords : their Assignes , and three liberall conceited Carriages , that 's the French but against the Danish ; why is this impon 'd as you call it ? *stop*
Osr . *stop*
The King Sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene you and him , hee shall not exceed you three hits ; He hath one twelue for mine , and that would come to imediate tryall , if your Lordship would vouchsafe the Answere Ham . *stop*
How if I answere no ? *stop*
Osr . *stop*
I meane my Lord , the opposition of your person in tryall Ham . *stop*
Sir , I will walke heere in the Hall ; if it please his Maiestie , 't is the breathing time of day with me ; let the Foyles bee brought , the Gentleman willing , and the King hold his purpose ; I will win for him if I can : if not , Ile gaine nothing but my shame , and the odde hits Osr . *stop*
Shall I redeliuer you ee ' n so ? *stop*
Ham . *stop*
To this effect Sir , after what flourish your nature will Osr . *stop*
I commend my duty to your Lordship Ham . *stop*
Yours , yours ; hee does well to commend it himselfe , there are no tongues else for 's tongue Hor . *stop*
This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his head Ham . *stop*
He did Complie with his Dugge before hee suck't it : thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty that I know the drossie age dotes on ; only got the tune of the time , and outward habite of encounter , a kinde of yesty collection , which carries them through & through the most fond and winnowed opinions ; and doe but blow them to their tryalls : the Bubbles are out Hor . *stop*
You will lose this wager , my Lord Ham . *stop*
I doe not thinke so , since he went into France , I haue beene in continuall practice ; I shall winne at the oddes : but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about my heart : but it is no matter Hor . *stop*
Nay , good my Lord Ham . *stop*
It is but foolery ; but it is such a kinde of gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman Hor . *stop*
If your minde dislike any thing , obey . *stop*
I will forestall their repaire hither , and say you are not fit Ham . *stop*
Not a whit , we defie Augury ; there 's a speciall Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow . *stop*
If it be now , 't is not to come : if it bee not to come , it will bee now : if it be not now ; yet it will come ; the readinesse is all , since no man ha 's ought of what he leaues . *stop*
What is't to leaue betimes ? *stop*
Enter King , Queene , Laertes and Lords , with other Attendants with Foyles , and Gauntlets , a Table and Flagons of Wine on it . *stop*
Kin . *stop*
Come Hamlet , come , and take this hand from me Ham . *stop*
Giue me your pardon Sir , I'ue done you wrong , But pardo n't as you are a Gentleman . *stop*
This presence knowes , And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht With sore distraction ? *stop*
What I haue done That might your nature honour , and exception Roughly awake , I heere proclaime was madnesse : Was't Hamlet wrong 'd Laertes ? *stop*
Neuer Hamlet . *stop*
If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away : And when he 's not himselfe , do 's wrong Laertes , Then Hamlet does it not , Hamlet denies it : Who does it then ? *stop*
His Madnesse ? *stop*
If't be so , Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong 'd , His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy . *stop*
Sir , in this Audience , Let my disclaiming from a purpos 'd euill , Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts , That I haue shot mine Arrow o 're the house , And hurt my Mother Laer . *stop*
I am satisfied in Nature , Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most To my Reuenge . *stop*
But in my termes of Honor I stand aloofe , and will no reconcilement , Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor , I haue a voyce , and president of peace To keepe my name vngorg 'd . *stop*
But till that time , I do receiue your offer 'd loue like loue , And wil not wrong it Ham . *stop*
I do embrace it freely , And will this Brothers wager frankely play . *stop*
Giue vs the Foyles : Come on Laer . *stop*
Come one for me Ham . *stop*
Ile be your foile Laertes , in mine ignorance , Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th ' darkest night , Sticke fiery off indeede Laer . *stop*
You mocke me Sir Ham . *stop*
No by this hand King . *stop*
Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke , Cousen Hamlet , you know the wager Ham . *stop*
Verie well my Lord , Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th ' weaker side King . *stop*
I do not feare it , I haue seene you both : But since he is better 'd , we haue therefore oddes Laer . *stop*
This is too heauy , Let me see another Ham . *stop*
This likes me well , These Foyles haue all a length . *stop*
Prepare to play . *stop*
Osricke . *stop*
I my good Lord King . *stop*
Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table : If Hamlet giue the first , or second hit , Or quit in answer of the third exchange , Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire , The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath , And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw Richer then that , which foure successiue Kings In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne . *stop*
Giue me the Cups , And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake , The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without , The Cannons to the Heauens , the Heauen to Earth , Now the King drinkes to Hamlet . *stop*
Come , begin , And you the Iudges beare a wary eye Ham . *stop*
Come on sir Laer . *stop*
Come on sir . *stop*
They play . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
One Laer . *stop*
No Ham . *stop*
Iudgement Osr . *stop*
A hit , a very palpable hit Laer . *stop*
Well : againe King . *stop*
Stay , giue me drinke . *stop*
Hamlet , this Pearle is thine , Here 's to thy health . *stop*
Giue him the cup , Trumpets sound , and shot goes off . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Ile play this bout first , set by a-while . *stop*
Come : Another hit ; what say you ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
A touch , a touch , I do confesse King . *stop*
Our Sonne shall win Qu . *stop*
He 's fat , and scant of breath . *stop*
Heere 's a Napkin , rub thy browes , The Queene Carowses to thy fortune , Hamlet Ham . *stop*
Good Madam King . *stop*
Gertrude , do not drinke Qu . *stop*
I will my Lord ; I pray you pardon me King . *stop*
It is the poyson 'd Cup , it is too late Ham . *stop*
I dare not drinke yet Madam , By and by Qu . *stop*
Come , let me wipe thy face Laer . *stop*
My Lord , Ile hit him now King . *stop*
I do not thinke't Laer . *stop*
And yet 't is almost 'gainst my conscience Ham . *stop*
Come for the third . *stop*
Laertes , you but dally , I pray you passe with your best violence , I am affear 'd you make a wanton of me Laer . *stop*
Say you so ? *stop*
Come on . *stop*
Play . *stop*
Osr . *stop*
Nothing neither way Laer . *stop*
Haue at you now . *stop*
In scuffling they change Rapiers . *stop*
King . *stop*
Part them , they are incens'd Ham . *stop*
Nay come , againe Osr . *stop*
Looke to the Queene there hoa Hor . *stop*
They bleed on both sides . *stop*
How is't my Lord ? *stop*
Osr . *stop*
How is't Laertes ? *stop*
Laer . *stop*
Why as a Woodcocke To mine Sprindge , Osricke , I am iustly kill 'd with mine owne Treacherie Ham . *stop*
How does the Queene ? *stop*
King . *stop*
She sounds to see them bleede Qu . *stop*
No , no , the drinke , the drinke . *stop*
Oh my deere Hamlet , the drinke , the drinke , I am poyson'd Ham . *stop*
Oh Villany ! *stop*
How ? *stop*
Let the doore be lock 'd . *stop*
Treacherie , seeke it out Laer . *stop*
It is heere Hamlet . *stop*
Hamlet , thou art slaine , No Medicine in the world can do thee good . *stop*
In thee , there is not halfe an houre of life ; The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand , Vnbated and envenom 'd : the foule practise Hath turn 'd it selfe on me . *stop*
Loe , heere I lye , Neuer to rise againe : Thy Mothers poyson 'd : I can no more , the King , the King 's too blame Ham . *stop*
The point envenom 'd too , Then venome to thy worke . *stop*
Hurts the King . *stop*
All . *stop*
Treason , Treason King . *stop*
O yet defend me Friends , I am but hurt Ham . *stop*
Heere thou incestuous , murdrous , Damned Dane , Drinke off this Potion : Is thy Vnion heere ? *stop*
Follow my Mother . *stop*
King Dyes . *stop*
Laer . *stop*
He is iustly seru 'd . *stop*
It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe : Exchange forgiuenesse with me , Noble Hamlet ; Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee , Nor thine on me . *stop*
Dyes . *stop*
Ham . *stop*
Heauen make thee free of it , I follow thee . *stop*
I am dead Horatio , wretched Queene adiew , You that looke pale , and tremble at this chance , That are but Mutes or audience to this acte : Had I but time ( as this fell Sergeant death Is strick 'd in his Arrest ) oh I could tell you . *stop*
But let it be : Horatio , I am dead , Thou liu'st , report me and my causes right To the vnsatisfied Hor . *stop*
Neuer beleeue it . *stop*
I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane : Heere 's yet some Liquor left Ham . *stop*
As th'art a man , giue me the Cup . *stop*
Let go , by Heauen Ile haue't . *stop*
Oh good Horatio , what a wounded name , ( Things standing thus vnknowne ) shall liue behind me . *stop*
If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart , Absent thee from felicitie awhile , And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine , To tell my Storie . *stop*
March afarre off , and shout within . *stop*
What warlike noyse is this ? *stop*
Enter Osricke . *stop*
Osr . *stop*
Yong Fortinbras , with conquest come fro [ m ] Poland To th ' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly Ham . *stop*
O I dye Horatio : The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit , I can not liue to heare the Newes from England , But I do prophesie th ' election lights On Fortinbras , he ha 's my dying voyce , So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse , Which haue solicited . *stop*
The rest is silence . *stop*
O , o , o , o. Dyes Hora . *stop*
Now cracke a Noble heart : Goodnight sweet Prince , And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest , Why do 's the Drumme come hither ? *stop*
Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador , with Drumme , Colours , and Attendants . *stop*
Fortin . *stop*
Where is this sight ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
What is it ye would see ; If ought of woe , or wonder , cease your search For . *stop*
His quarry cries on hauocke . *stop*
Oh proud death , What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell . *stop*
That thou so many Princes , at a shoote , So bloodily hast strooke Amb . *stop*
The sight is dismall , And our affaires from England come too late , The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing , To tell him his command'ment is fulfill 'd , That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead : Where should we haue our thankes ? *stop*
Hor . *stop*
Not from his mouth , Had it th ' abilitie of life to thanke you : He neuer gaue command'ment for their death . *stop*
But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question , You from the Polake warres , and you from England Are heere arriued . *stop*
Giue order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view , And let me speake to th ' yet vnknowing world , How these things came about . *stop*
So shall you heare Of carnall , bloudie , and vnnaturall acts , Of accidentall iudgements , casuall slaughters Of death 's put on by cunning , and forc 'd cause , And in this vpshot , purposes mistooke , Falne on the Inuentors head . *stop*
All this can I Truly deliuer For . *stop*
Let vs hast to heare it , And call the Noblest to the Audience . *stop*
For me , with sorrow , I embrace my Fortune , I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome , Which are to claime , my vantage doth Inuite me , Hor . *stop*
Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake , And from his mouth Whose voyce will draw on more : But let this same be presently perform 'd , Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde , Lest more mischance On plots , and errors happen For . *stop*
Let foure Captaines Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage , For he was likely , had he beene put on To haue prou 'd most royally : And for his passage , The Souldiours Musicke , and the rites of Warre Speake lowdly for him . *stop*
Take vp the body ; Such a sight as this Becomes the Field , but heere shewes much amis . *stop*
Go , bid the Souldiers shoote . *stop*
Exeunt . *stop*
Marching : after the which , a Peale of Ordenance are shot off . *stop*
