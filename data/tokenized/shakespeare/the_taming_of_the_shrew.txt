THE TAMING OF THE SHREW By William Shakespeare SCENE : Padua , and PETRUCHIO 'S house in the country SC_1 INDUCTION . *stop*
SCENE I . *stop*
Before an alehouse on a heath Enter HOSTESS and SLY SLY . *stop*
I 'll pheeze you , in faith . *stop*
HOSTESS . *stop*
A pair of stocks , you rogue ! *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Y'are a baggage ; the Slys are no rogues . *stop*
Look in the chronicles : we came in with Richard Conqueror . *stop*
Therefore , paucas pallabris ; let the world slide . *stop*
Sessa ! *stop*
HOSTESS . *stop*
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst ? *stop*
SLY . *stop*
No , not a denier . *stop*
Go by , Saint Jeronimy , go to thy cold bed and warm thee . *stop*
HOSTESS . *stop*
I know my remedy ; I must go fetch the third-borough . *stop*
Exit SLY . *stop*
Third , or fourth , or fifth borough , I 'll answer him by law . *stop*
I 'll not budge an inch , boy ; let him come , and kindly . *stop*
[ Falls asleep ] Wind horns . *stop*
Enter a LORD from hunting , with his train LORD . *stop*
Huntsman , I charge thee , tender well my hounds ; Brach Merriman , the poor cur , is emboss 'd ; And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth 'd brach . *stop*
Saw'st thou not , boy , how Silver made it good At the hedge corner , in the coldest fault ? *stop*
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound . *stop*
FIRST HUNTSMAN . *stop*
Why , Belman is as good as he , my lord ; He cried upon it at the merest loss , And twice to-day pick 'd out the dullest scent ; Trust me , I take him for the better dog . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Thou art a fool ; if Echo were as fleet , I would esteem him worth a dozen such . *stop*
But sup them well , and look unto them all ; To-morrow I intend to hunt again . *stop*
FIRST HUNTSMAN . *stop*
I will , my lord . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
What 's here ? *stop*
One dead , or drunk ? *stop*
See , doth he breathe ? *stop*
SECOND HUNTSMAN . *stop*
He breathes , my lord . *stop*
Were he not warm 'd with ale , This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
O monstrous beast , how like a swine he lies ! *stop*
Grim death , how foul and loathsome is thine image ! *stop*
Sirs , I will practise on this drunken man . *stop*
What think you , if he were convey 'd to bed , Wrapp 'd in sweet clothes , rings put upon his fingers , A most delicious banquet by his bed , And brave attendants near him when he wakes , Would not the beggar then forget himself ? *stop*
FIRST HUNTSMAN . *stop*
Believe me , lord , I think he can not choose . *stop*
SECOND HUNTSMAN . *stop*
It would seem strange unto him when he wak 'd . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy . *stop*
Then take him up , and manage well the jest : Carry him gently to my fairest chamber , And hang it round with all my wanton pictures ; Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters , And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet ; Procure me music ready when he wakes , To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound ; And if he chance to speak , be ready straight , And with a low submissive reverence Say 'What is it your honour will command ? ' *stop*
Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose-water and bestrew 'd with flowers ; Another bear the ewer , the third a diaper , And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands ? ' *stop*
Some one be ready with a costly suit , And ask him what apparel he will wear ; Another tell him of his hounds and horse , And that his lady mourns at his disease ; Persuade him that he hath been lunatic , And , when he says he is , say that he dreams , For he is nothing but a mighty lord . *stop*
This do , and do it kindly , gentle sirs ; It will be pastime passing excellent , If it be husbanded with modesty . *stop*
FIRST HUNTSMAN . *stop*
My lord , I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Take him up gently , and to bed with him ; And each one to his office when he wakes . *stop*
[ SLY is carried out . *stop*
A trumpet sounds ] Sirrah , go see what trumpet 't is that sounds- Exit SERVANT Belike some noble gentleman that means , Travelling some journey , to repose him here . *stop*
Re-enter a SERVINGMAN How now ! *stop*
who is it ? *stop*
SERVANT . *stop*
A n't please your honour , players That offer service to your lordship . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Bid them come near . *stop*
Enter PLAYERS Now , fellows , you are welcome . *stop*
PLAYERS . *stop*
We thank your honour . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Do you intend to stay with me to-night ? *stop*
PLAYER . *stop*
So please your lordship to accept our duty . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
With all my heart . *stop*
This fellow I remember Since once he play 'd a farmer 's eldest son ; 'T was where you woo 'd the gentlewoman so well . *stop*
I have forgot your name ; but , sure , that part Was aptly fitted and naturally perform 'd . *stop*
PLAYER . *stop*
I think 't was Soto that your honour means . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
'T is very true ; thou didst it excellent . *stop*
Well , you are come to me in happy time , The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much . *stop*
There is a lord will hear you play to-night ; But I am doubtful of your modesties , Lest , over-eying of his odd behaviour , For yet his honour never heard a play , You break into some merry passion And so offend him ; for I tell you , sirs , If you should smile , he grows impatient . *stop*
PLAYER . *stop*
Fear not , my lord ; we can contain ourselves , Were he the veriest antic in the world . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Go , sirrah , take them to the buttery , And give them friendly welcome every one ; Let them want nothing that my house affords . *stop*
Exit one with the PLAYERS Sirrah , go you to Bartholomew my page , And see him dress 'd in all suits like a lady ; That done , conduct him to the drunkard 's chamber , And call him 'madam , ' do him obeisance . *stop*
Tell him from me- as he will win my love- He bear himself with honourable action , Such as he hath observ 'd in noble ladies Unto their lords , by them accomplished ; Such duty to the drunkard let him do , With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy , And say 'What is't your honour will command , Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty and make known her love ? ' *stop*
And then with kind embracements , tempting kisses , And with declining head into his bosom , Bid him shed tears , as being overjoyed To see her noble lord restor 'd to health , Who for this seven years hath esteemed him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar . *stop*
And if the boy have not a woman 's gift To rain a shower of commanded tears , An onion will do well for such a shift , Which , in a napkin being close convey 'd , Shall in despite enforce a watery eye . *stop*
See this dispatch 'd with all the haste thou canst ; Anon I 'll give thee more instructions . *stop*
Exit a SERVINGMAN I know the boy will well usurp the grace , Voice , gait , and action , of a gentlewoman ; I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband ' ; And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant . *stop*
I 'll in to counsel them ; haply my presence May well abate the over-merry spleen , Which otherwise would grow into extremes . *stop*
Exeunt SC_2 SCENE II . *stop*
A bedchamber in the LORD 'S house Enter aloft SLY , with ATTENDANTS ; some with apparel , basin and ewer , and other appurtenances ; and LORD SLY . *stop*
For God 's sake , a pot of small ale . *stop*
FIRST SERVANT . *stop*
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack ? *stop*
SECOND SERVANT . *stop*
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves ? *stop*
THIRD SERVANT . *stop*
What raiment will your honour wear to-day ? *stop*
SLY . *stop*
I am Christophero Sly ; call not me 'honour ' nor 'lordship . ' *stop*
I ne'er drank sack in my life ; and if you give me any conserves , give me conserves of beef . *stop*
Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear , for I have no more doublets than backs , no more stockings than legs , nor no more shoes than feet- nay , sometime more feet than shoes , or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour ! *stop*
O , that a mighty man of such descent , Of such possessions , and so high esteem , Should be infused with so foul a spirit ! *stop*
SLY . *stop*
What , would you make me mad ? *stop*
Am not I Christopher Sly , old Sly 's son of Burton Heath ; by birth a pedlar , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bear-herd , and now by present profession a tinker ? *stop*
Ask Marian Hacket , the fat ale-wife of Wincot , if she know me not ; if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale , score me up for the lying'st knave in Christendom . *stop*
What ! *stop*
I am not bestraught . *stop*
[ Taking a pot of ale ] Here's- THIRD SERVANT . *stop*
O , this it is that makes your lady mourn ! *stop*
SECOND SERVANT . *stop*
O , this is it that makes your servants droop ! *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house , As beaten hence by your strange lunacy . *stop*
O noble lord , bethink thee of thy birth ! *stop*
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment , And banish hence these abject lowly dreams . *stop*
Look how thy servants do attend on thee , Each in his office ready at thy beck . *stop*
Wilt thou have music ? *stop*
Hark ! *stop*
Apollo plays , [ Music ] And twenty caged nightingales do sing . *stop*
Or wilt thou sleep ? *stop*
We 'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimm 'd up for Semiramis . *stop*
Say thou wilt walk : we will bestrew the ground . *stop*
Or wilt thou ride ? *stop*
Thy horses shall be trapp 'd , Their harness studded all with gold and pearl . *stop*
Dost thou love hawking ? *stop*
Thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark . *stop*
Or wilt thou hunt ? *stop*
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth . *stop*
FIRST SERVANT . *stop*
Say thou wilt course ; thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags ; ay , fleeter than the roe . *stop*
SECOND SERVANT . *stop*
Dost thou love pictures ? *stop*
We will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook , And Cytherea all in sedges hid , Which seem to move and wanton with her breath Even as the waving sedges play wi ' th ' wind . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
We 'll show thee lo as she was a maid And how she was beguiled and surpris 'd , As lively painted as the deed was done . *stop*
THIRD SERVANT . *stop*
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood , Scratching her legs , that one shall swear she bleeds And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep , So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn . *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Thou art a lord , and nothing but a lord . *stop*
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age . *stop*
FIRST SERVANT . *stop*
And , till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face , She was the fairest creature in the world ; And yet she is inferior to none . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Am I a lord and have I such a lady ? *stop*
Or do I dream ? *stop*
Or have I dream 'd till now ? *stop*
I do not sleep : I see , I hear , I speak ; I smell sweet savours , and I feel soft things . *stop*
Upon my life , I am a lord indeed , And not a tinker , nor Christopher Sly . *stop*
Well , bring our lady hither to our sight ; And once again , a pot o ' th ' smallest ale . *stop*
SECOND SERVANT . *stop*
Will't please your Mightiness to wash your hands ? *stop*
O , how we joy to see your wit restor 'd ! *stop*
O , that once more you knew but what you are ! *stop*
These fifteen years you have been in a dream ; Or , when you wak 'd , so wak 'd as if you slept . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
These fifteen years ! *stop*
by my fay , a goodly nap . *stop*
But did I never speak of all that time ? *stop*
FIRST SERVANT . *stop*
O , yes , my lord , but very idle words ; For though you lay here in this goodly chamber , Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door ; And rail upon the hostess of the house , And say you would present her at the leet , Because she brought stone jugs and no seal 'd quarts . *stop*
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Ay , the woman 's maid of the house . *stop*
THIRD SERVANT . *stop*
Why , sir , you know no house nor no such maid , Nor no such men as you have reckon 'd up , As Stephen Sly , and old John Naps of Greece , And Peter Turph , and Henry Pimpernell ; And twenty more such names and men as these , Which never were , nor no man ever saw . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Now , Lord be thanked for my good amends ! *stop*
ALL . *stop*
Amen . *stop*
Enter the PAGE as a lady , with ATTENDANTS SLY . *stop*
I thank thee ; thou shalt not lose by it . *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
How fares my noble lord ? *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Marry , I fare well ; for here is cheer enough . *stop*
Where is my wife ? *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
Here , noble lord ; what is thy will with her ? *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Are you my wife , and will not call me husband ? *stop*
My men should call me 'lord ' ; I am your goodman . *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
My husband and my lord , my lord and husband ; I am your wife in all obedience . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
I know it well . *stop*
What must I call her ? *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Madam . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Al'ce madam , or Joan madam ? *stop*
LORD . *stop*
Madam , and nothing else ; so lords call ladies . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Madam wife , they say that I have dream'd And slept above some fifteen year or more . *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
Ay , and the time seems thirty unto me , Being all this time abandon 'd from your bed . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
'T is much . *stop*
Servants , leave me and her alone . *stop*
Exeunt SERVANTS Madam , undress you , and come now to bed . *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
Thrice noble lord , let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two ; Or , if not so , until the sun be set . *stop*
For your physicians have expressly charg 'd , In peril to incur your former malady , That I should yet absent me from your bed . *stop*
I hope this reason stands for my excuse . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Ay , it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long . *stop*
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again . *stop*
I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood . *stop*
Enter a MESSENGER MESSENGER . *stop*
Your honour 's players , hearing your amendment , Are come to play a pleasant comedy ; For so your doctors hold it very meet , Seeing too much sadness hath congeal 'd your blood , And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy . *stop*
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment , Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Marry , I will ; let them play it . *stop*
Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick ? *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
No , my good lord , it is more pleasing stuff . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
What , household stuff ? *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
It is a kind of history . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Well , we 'll see't . *stop*
Come , madam wife , sit by my side and let the world slip ; -we shall ne'er be younger . *stop*

SCENE I. Padua . *stop*
A public place Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO LUCENTIO . *stop*
Tranio , since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua , nursery of arts , I am arriv 'd for fruitful Lombardy , The pleasant garden of great Italy , And by my father 's love and leave am arm'd With his good will and thy good company , My trusty servant well approv 'd in all , Here let us breathe , and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies . *stop*
Pisa , renowned for grave citizens , Gave me my being and my father first , A merchant of great traffic through the world , Vincentio , come of the Bentivolii ; Vincentio 's son , brought up in Florence , It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv 'd , To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds . *stop*
And therefore , Tranio , for the time I study , Virtue and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achiev 'd . *stop*
Tell me thy mind ; for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep , And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Mi perdonato , gentle master mine ; I am in all affected as yourself ; Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy . *stop*
Only , good master , while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline , Let 's be no Stoics nor no stocks , I pray , Or so devote to Aristotle 's checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur 'd . *stop*
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have , And practise rhetoric in your common talk ; Music and poesy use to quicken you ; The mathematics and the metaphysics , Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you . *stop*
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en ; In brief , sir , study what you most affect . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Gramercies , Tranio , well dost thou advise . *stop*
If , Biondello , thou wert come ashore , We could at once put us in readiness , And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget . *stop*
Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters , KATHERINA and BIANCA ; GREMIO , a pantaloon ; HORTENSIO , suitor to BIANCA . *stop*
LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by But stay awhile ; what company is this ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Master , some show to welcome us to town . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Gentlemen , importune me no farther , For how I firmly am resolv 'd you know ; That is , not to bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder . *stop*
If either of you both love Katherina , Because I know you well and love you well , Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
To cart her rather . *stop*
She 's too rough for me . *stop*
There , there , Hortensio , will you any wife ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
[ To BAPTISTA ] I pray you , sir , is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Mates , maid ! *stop*
How mean you that ? *stop*
No mates for you , Unless you were of gentler , milder mould . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I ' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear ; Iwis it is not halfway to her heart ; But if it were , doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legg 'd stool , And paint your face , and use you like a fool . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
From all such devils , good Lord deliver us ! *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
And me , too , good Lord ! *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Husht , master ! *stop*
Here 's some good pastime toward ; That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
But in the other 's silence do I see Maid 's mild behaviour and sobriety . *stop*
Peace , Tranio ! *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Well said , master ; mum ! *stop*
and gaze your fill . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Gentlemen , that I may soon make good What I have said- Bianca , get you in ; And let it not displease thee , good Bianca , For I will love thee ne'er the less , my girl . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
A pretty peat ! *stop*
it is best Put finger in the eye , an she knew why . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Sister , content you in my discontent . *stop*
Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe ; My books and instruments shall be my company , On them to look , and practise by myself . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Hark , Tranio , thou mayst hear Minerva speak ! *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Signior Baptista , will you be so strange ? *stop*
Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca 's grief . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Why will you mew her up , Signior Baptista , for this fiend of hell , And make her bear the penance of her tongue ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Gentlemen , content ye ; I am resolv 'd . *stop*
Go in , Bianca . *stop*
Exit BIANCA And for I know she taketh most delight In music , instruments , and poetry , Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth . *stop*
If you , Hortensio , Or , Signior Gremio , you , know any such , Prefer them hither ; for to cunning men I will be very kind , and liberal To mine own children in good bringing-up ; And so , farewell . *stop*
Katherina , you may stay ; For I have more to commune with Bianca . *stop*
Exit KATHERINA . *stop*
Why , and I trust I may go too , may I not ? *stop*
What ! *stop*
shall I be appointed hours , as though , belike , I knew not what to take and what to leave ? *stop*
Ha ! *stop*
Exit GREMIO . *stop*
You may go to the devil 's dam ; your gifts are so good here 's none will hold you . *stop*
There ! *stop*
Love is not so great , Hortensio , but we may blow our nails together , and fast it fairly out ; our cake 's dough on both sides . *stop*
Farewell ; yet , for the love I bear my sweet Bianca , if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights , I will wish him to her father . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
SO Will I , Signior Gremio ; but a word , I pray . *stop*
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brook 'd parle , know now , upon advice , it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress , and be happy rivals in Bianca 's love- to labour and effect one thing specially . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
What 's that , I pray ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Marry , sir , to get a husband for her sister . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
A husband ? *stop*
a devil . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
I say a husband . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
I say a devil . *stop*
Think'st thou , Hortensio , though her father be very rich , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Tush , Gremio ! *stop*
Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums , why , man , there be good fellows in the world , an a man could light on them , would take her with all faults , and money enough . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
I can not tell ; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition : to be whipp 'd at the high cross every morning . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Faith , as you say , there 's small choice in rotten apples . *stop*
But , come ; since this bar in law makes us friends , it shall be so far forth friendly maintain 'd till by helping Baptista 's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband , and then have to't afresh . *stop*
Sweet Bianca ! *stop*
Happy man be his dole ! *stop*
He that runs fastest gets the ring . *stop*
How say you , Signior Gremio ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
I am agreed ; and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her , wed her , and bed her , and rid the house of her ! *stop*
Come on . *stop*
Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO TRANIO . *stop*
I pray , sir , tell me , is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
O Tranio , till I found it to be true , I never thought it possible or likely . *stop*
But see ! *stop*
while idly I stood looking on , I found the effect of love in idleness ; And now in plainness do confess to thee , That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was- Tranio , I burn , I pine , I perish , Tranio , If I achieve not this young modest girl . *stop*
Counsel me , Tranio , for I know thou canst ; Assist me , Tranio , for I know thou wilt . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Master , it is no time to chide you now ; Affection is not rated from the heart ; If love have touch 'd you , nought remains but so : 'Redime te captum quam queas minimo . ' *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Gramercies , lad . *stop*
Go forward ; this contents ; The rest will comfort , for thy counsel 's sound . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Master , you look 'd so longly on the maid . *stop*
Perhaps you mark 'd not what 's the pith of all . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
O , yes , I saw sweet beauty in her face , Such as the daughter of Agenor had , That made great Jove to humble him to her hand , When with his knees he kiss 'd the Cretan strand . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Saw you no more ? *stop*
Mark 'd you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Tranio , I saw her coral lips to move , And with her breath she did perfume the air ; Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Nay , then 't is time to stir him from his trance . *stop*
I pray , awake , sir . *stop*
If you love the maid , Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her . *stop*
Thus it stands : Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd That , till the father rid his hands of her , Master , your love must live a maid at home ; And therefore has he closely mew 'd her up , Because she will not be annoy 'd with suitors . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Ah , Tranio , what a cruel father 's he ! *stop*
But art thou not advis 'd he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Ay , marry , am I , sir , and now 't is plotted . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
I have it , Tranio . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Master , for my hand , Both our inventions meet and jump in one . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Tell me thine first . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
You will be schoolmaster , And undertake the teaching of the maid- That 's your device . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
It is . *stop*
May it be done ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Not possible ; for who shall bear your part And be in Padua here Vincentio 's son ; Keep house and ply his book , welcome his friends , Visit his countrymen , and banquet them ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Basta , content thee , for I have it full . *stop*
We have not yet been seen in any house , Nor can we be distinguish 'd by our faces For man or master . *stop*
Then it follows thus : Thou shalt be master , Tranio , in my stead , Keep house and port and servants , as I should ; I will some other be- some Florentine , Some Neapolitan , or meaner man of Pisa . *stop*
'T is hatch 'd , and shall be so . *stop*
Tranio , at once Uncase thee ; take my colour 'd hat and cloak . *stop*
When Biondello comes , he waits on thee ; But I will charm him first to keep his tongue . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
So had you need . *stop*
[ They exchange habits ] In brief , sir , sith it your pleasure is , And I am tied to be obedient- For so your father charg 'd me at our parting : 'Be serviceable to my son ' quoth he , Although I think 't was in another sense- I am content to be Lucentio , Because so well I love Lucentio . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Tranio , be so because Lucentio loves ; And let me be a slave t ' achieve that maid Whose sudden sight hath thrall 'd my wounded eye . *stop*
Enter BIONDELLO . *stop*
Here comes the rogue . *stop*
Sirrah , where have you been ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Where have I been ! *stop*
Nay , how now ! *stop*
where are you ? *stop*
Master , has my fellow Tranio stol ' n your clothes ? *stop*
Or you stol ' n his ? *stop*
or both ? *stop*
Pray , what 's the news ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Sirrah , come hither ; 't is no time to jest , And therefore frame your manners to the time . *stop*
Your fellow Tranio here , to save my life , Puts my apparel and my count'nance on , And I for my escape have put on his ; For in a quarrel since I came ashore I kill 'd a man , and fear I was descried . *stop*
Wait you on him , I charge you , as becomes , While I make way from hence to save my life . *stop*
You understand me ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
I , sir ? *stop*
Ne'er a whit . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth : Tranio is chang 'd into Lucentio . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
The better for him ; would I were so too ! *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
So could I , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , That Lucentio indeed had Baptista 's youngest daughter . *stop*
But , sirrah , not for my sake but your master 's , I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies . *stop*
When I am alone , why , then I am Tranio ; But in all places else your master Lucentio . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Tranio , let 's go . *stop*
One thing more rests , that thyself execute- To make one among these wooers . *stop*
If thou ask me why- Sufficeth , my reasons are both good and weighty . *stop*
Exeunt The Presenters above speak FIRST SERVANT . *stop*
My lord , you nod ; you do not mind the play . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
Yes , by Saint Anne do I . *stop*
A good matter , surely ; comes there any more of it ? *stop*
PAGE . *stop*
My lord , 't is but begun . *stop*
SLY . *stop*
'T is a very excellent piece of work , madam lady Would 'twere done ! *stop*
[ They sit and mark ] SCENE II . *stop*
Padua . *stop*
Before HORTENSIO 'S house Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Verona , for a while I take my leave , To see my friends in Padua ; but of all My best beloved and approved friend , Hortensio ; and I trow this is his house . *stop*
Here , sirrah Grumio , knock , I say . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Knock , sir ! *stop*
Whom should I knock ? *stop*
Is there any man has rebus 'd your worship ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Villain , I say , knock me here soundly . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Knock you here , sir ? *stop*
Why , sir , what am I , sir , that I should knock you here , sir ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Villain , I say , knock me at this gate , And rap me well , or I 'll knock your knave 's pate . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
My master is grown quarrelsome . *stop*
I should knock you first , And then I know after who comes by the worst . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Will it not be ? *stop*
Faith , sirrah , an you 'll not knock I 'll ring it ; I 'll try how you can sol-fa , and sing it . *stop*
[ He wrings him by the ears ] GRUMIO . *stop*
Help , masters , help ! *stop*
My master is mad . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Now knock when I bid you , sirrah villain ! *stop*
Enter HORTENSIO HORTENSIO . *stop*
How now ! *stop*
what 's the matter ? *stop*
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio ! *stop*
How do you all at Verona ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Signior Hortensio , come you to part the fray ? *stop*
'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato ' may I say . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Alla nostra casa ben venuto , Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio . *stop*
Rise , Grumio , rise ; we will compound this quarrel . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Nay , 't is no matter , sir , what he 'leges in Latin . *stop*
If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you , sir : he bid me knock him and rap him soundly , sir . *stop*
Well , was it fit for a servant to use his master so ; being , perhaps , for aught I see , two and thirty , a pip out ? *stop*
Whom would to God I had well knock 'd at first , Then had not Grumio come by the worst . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
A senseless villain ! *stop*
Good Hortensio , I bade the rascal knock upon your gate , And could not get him for my heart to do it . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Knock at the gate ? *stop*
O heavens ! *stop*
Spake you not these words plain : 'Sirrah knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly ' ? *stop*
And come you now with 'knocking at the gate ' ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Sirrah , be gone , or talk not , I advise you . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Petruchio , patience ; I am Grumio 's pledge ; Why , this 's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you , Your ancient , trusty , pleasant servant Grumio . *stop*
And tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home , Where small experience grows . *stop*
But in a few , Signior Hortensio , thus it stands with me : Antonio , my father , is deceas 'd , And I have thrust myself into this maze , Haply to wive and thrive as best I may ; Crowns in my purse I have , and goods at home , And so am come abroad to see the world . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Petruchio , shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour 'd wife ? *stop*
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel , And yet I 'll promise thee she shall be rich , And very rich ; but th'art too much my friend , And I 'll not wish thee to her . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Signior Hortensio , 'twixt such friends as we Few words suffice ; and therefore , if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio 's wife , As wealth is burden of my wooing dance , Be she as foul as was Florentius ' love , As old as Sibyl , and as curst and shrewd As Socrates ' Xanthippe or a worse- She moves me not , or not removes , at least , Affection 's edge in me , were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas . *stop*
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua ; If wealthily , then happily in Padua . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Nay , look you , sir , he tells you flatly what his mind is . *stop*
Why , give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby , or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head , though she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses . *stop*
Why , nothing comes amiss , so money comes withal . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Petruchio , since we are stepp 'd thus far in , I will continue that I broach 'd in jest . *stop*
I can , Petruchio , help thee to a wife With wealth enough , and young and beauteous ; Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman ; Her only fault , and that is faults enough , Is- that she is intolerable curst , And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure That , were my state far worser than it is , I would not wed her for a mine of gold . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Hortensio , peace ! *stop*
thou know'st not gold 's effect . *stop*
Tell me her father 's name , and 't is enough ; For I will board her though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Her father is Baptista Minola , An affable and courteous gentleman ; Her name is Katherina Minola , Renown 'd in Padua for her scolding tongue . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I know her father , though I know not her ; And he knew my deceased father well . *stop*
I will not sleep , Hortensio , till I see her ; And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter , Unless you will accompany me thither . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
I pray you , sir , let him go while the humour lasts . *stop*
O' my word , and she knew him as well as I do , she would think scolding would do little good upon him . *stop*
She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so . *stop*
Why , that 's nothing ; and he begin once , he'll rail in his rope-tricks . *stop*
I 'll tell you what , sir : an she stand him but a little , he will throw a figure in her face , and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat . *stop*
You know him not , sir . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Tarry , Petruchio , I must go with thee , For in Baptista 's keep my treasure is . *stop*
He hath the jewel of my life in hold , His youngest daughter , beautiful Bianca ; And her withholds from me , and other more , Suitors to her and rivals in my love ; Supposing it a thing impossible- For those defects I have before rehears'd- That ever Katherina will be woo 'd . *stop*
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en , That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katherine the curst have got a husband . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Katherine the curst ! *stop*
A title for a maid of all titles the worst . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace , And offer me disguis 'd in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music , to instruct Bianca ; That so I may by this device at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her , And unsuspected court her by herself . *stop*
Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO GRUMIO . *stop*
Here 's no knavery ! *stop*
See , to beguile the old folks , how the young folks lay their heads together ! *stop*
Master , master , look about you . *stop*
Who goes there , ha ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Peace , Grumio ! *stop*
It is the rival of my love . *stop*
Petruchio , stand by awhile . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
A proper stripling , and an amorous ! *stop*
[ They stand aside ] GREMIO . *stop*
O , very well ; I have perus 'd the note . *stop*
Hark you , sir ; I 'll have them very fairly bound- All books of love , see that at any hand ; And see you read no other lectures to her . *stop*
You understand me- over and beside Signior Baptista 's liberality , I 'll mend it with a largess . *stop*
Take your paper too , And let me have them very well perfum 'd ; For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to . *stop*
What will you read to her ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Whate'er I read to her , I 'll plead for you As for my patron , stand you so assur 'd , As firmly as yourself were still in place ; Yea , and perhaps with more successful words Than you , unless you were a scholar , sir . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
O this learning , what a thing it is ! *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
O this woodcock , what an ass it is ! *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Peace , sirrah ! *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Grumio , mum ! *stop*
[ Coming forward ] God save you , Signior Gremio ! *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
And you are well met , Signior Hortensio . *stop*
Trow you whither I am going ? *stop*
To Baptista Minola . *stop*
I promis 'd to enquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca ; And by good fortune I have lighted well On this young man ; for learning and behaviour Fit for her turn , well read in poetry And other books- good ones , I warrant ye . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
'T is well ; and I have met a gentleman Hath promis 'd me to help me to another , A fine musician to instruct our mistress ; So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca , so beloved of me . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
And that his bags shall prove . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Gremio , 't is now no time to vent our love . *stop*
Listen to me , and if you speak me fair I 'll tell you news indifferent good for either . *stop*
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met , Upon agreement from us to his liking , Will undertake to woo curst Katherine ; Yea , and to marry her , if her dowry please . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
So said , so done , is well . *stop*
Hortensio , have you told him all her faults ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I know she is an irksome brawling scold ; If that be all , masters , I hear no harm . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
No , say'st me so , friend ? *stop*
What countryman ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Born in Verona , old Antonio 's son . *stop*
My father dead , my fortune lives for me ; And I do hope good days and long to see . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
O Sir , such a life with such a wife were strange ! *stop*
But if you have a stomach , to't a God 's name ; You shall have me assisting you in all . *stop*
But will you woo this wild-cat ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Will I live ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Will he woo her ? *stop*
Ay , or I 'll hang her . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why came I hither but to that intent ? *stop*
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears ? *stop*
Have I not in my time heard lions roar ? *stop*
Have I not heard the sea , puff 'd up with winds , Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ? *stop*
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field , And heaven 's artillery thunder in the skies ? *stop*
Have I not in a pitched battle heard Loud 'larums , neighing steeds , and trumpets ' clang ? *stop*
And do you tell me of a woman 's tongue , That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a fariner 's fire ? *stop*
Tush ! *stop*
tush ! *stop*
fear boys with bugs . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
For he fears none . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Hortensio , hark : This gentleman is happily arriv 'd , My mind presumes , for his own good and ours . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
I promis 'd we would be contributors And bear his charge of wooing , whatsoe'er . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
And so we will- provided that he win her . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
I would I were as sure of a good dinner . *stop*
Enter TRANIO , bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO , and BIONDELLO TRANIO . *stop*
Gentlemen , God save you ! *stop*
If I may be bold , Tell me , I beseech you , which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
He that has the two fair daughters ; is't he you mean ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Even he , Biondello . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Hark you , sir , you mean not her to- TRANIO . *stop*
Perhaps him and her , sir ; what have you to do ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Not her that chides , sir , at any hand , I pray . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
I love no chiders , sir . *stop*
Biondello , let 's away . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
[ Aside ] Well begun , Tranio . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Sir , a word ere you go . *stop*
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of , yea or no ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
And if I be , sir , is it any offence ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
No ; if without more words you will get you hence . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Why , sir , I pray , are not the streets as free For me as for you ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
But so is not she . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
For what reason , I beseech you ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
For this reason , if you 'll know , That she 's the choice love of Signior Gremio . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
That she 's the chosen of Signior Hortensio . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Softly , my masters ! *stop*
If you be gentlemen , Do me this right- hear me with patience . *stop*
Baptista is a noble gentleman , To whom my father is not all unknown , And , were his daughter fairer than she is , She may more suitors have , and me for one . *stop*
Fair Leda 's daughter had a thousand wooers ; Then well one more may fair Bianca have ; And so she shall : Lucentio shall make one , Though Paris came in hope to speed alone . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
What , this gentleman will out-talk us all ! *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Sir , give him head ; I know he 'll prove a jade . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Hortensio , to what end are all these words ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Sir , let me be so bold as ask you , Did you yet ever see Baptista 's daughter ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
No , sir , but hear I do that he hath two : The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Sir , sir , the first 's for me ; let her go by . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Yea , leave that labour to great Hercules , And let it be more than Alcides ' twelve . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Sir , understand you this of me , in sooth : The youngest daughter , whom you hearken for , Her father keeps from all access of suitors , And will not promise her to any man Until the elder sister first be wed . *stop*
The younger then is free , and not before . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
If it be so , sir , that you are the man Must stead us all , and me amongst the rest ; And if you break the ice , and do this feat , Achieve the elder , set the younger free For our access- whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Sir , you say well , and well you do conceive ; And since you do profess to be a suitor , You must , as we do , gratify this gentleman , To whom we all rest generally beholding . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Sir , I shall not be slack ; in sign whereof , Please ye we may contrive this afternoon , And quaff carouses to our mistress ' health ; And do as adversaries do in law- Strive mightily , but eat and drink as friends . *stop*
GRUMIO , BIONDELLO . *stop*
O excellent motion ! *stop*
Fellows , let 's be gone . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
The motion 's good indeed , and be it so . *stop*
Petruchio , I shall be your ben venuto . *stop*

SCENE I. Padua . *stop*
BAPTISTA 'S house Enter KATHERINA and BIANCA BIANCA . *stop*
Good sister , wrong me not , nor wrong yourself , To make a bondmaid and a slave of me- That I disdain ; but for these other gawds , Unbind my hands , I 'll pull them off myself , Yea , all my raiment , to my petticoat ; Or what you will command me will I do , So well I know my duty to my elders . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell Whom thou lov'st best . *stop*
See thou dissemble not . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Believe me , sister , of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Minion , thou liest . *stop*
Is't not Hortensio ? *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
If you affect him , sister , here I swear I 'll plead for you myself but you shall have him . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
O then , belike , you fancy riches more : You will have Gremio to keep you fair . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Is it for him you do envy me so ? *stop*
Nay , then you jest ; and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while . *stop*
I prithee , sister Kate , untie my hands . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
[ Strikes her ] If that be jest , then an the rest was so . *stop*
Enter BAPTISTA BAPTISTA . *stop*
Why , how now , dame ! *stop*
Whence grows this insolence ? *stop*
Bianca , stand aside- poor girl ! *stop*
she weeps . *stop*
[ He unbinds her ] Go ply thy needle ; meddle not with her . *stop*
For shame , thou hilding of a devilish spirit , Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee ? *stop*
When did she cross thee with a bitter word ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Her silence flouts me , and I 'll be reveng 'd . *stop*
[ Flies after BIANCA ] BAPTISTA . *stop*
What , in my sight ? *stop*
Bianca , get thee in . *stop*
Exit BIANCA KATHERINA . *stop*
What , will you not suffer me ? *stop*
Nay , now I see She is your treasure , she must have a husband ; I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day , And for your love to her lead apes in hell . *stop*
Talk not to me ; I will go sit and weep , Till I can find occasion of revenge . *stop*
Exit KATHERINA BAPTISTA . *stop*
Was ever gentleman thus griev 'd as I ? *stop*
But who comes here ? *stop*
Enter GREMIO , with LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man ; PETRUCHIO , with HORTENSIO as a musician ; and TRANIO , as LUCENTIO , with his boy , BIONDELLO , bearing a lute and books GREMIO . *stop*
Good morrow , neighbour Baptista . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Good morrow , neighbour Gremio . *stop*
God save you , gentlemen ! *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
And you , good sir ! *stop*
Pray , have you not a daughter Call 'd Katherina , fair and virtuous ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
I have a daughter , sir , call 'd Katherina . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
You are too blunt ; go to it orderly . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
You wrong me , Signior Gremio ; give me leave . *stop*
I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , That , hearing of her beauty and her wit , Her affability and bashful modesty , Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour , Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house , to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard . *stop*
And , for an entrance to my entertainment , I do present you with a man of mine , [ Presenting HORTENSIO ] Cunning in music and the mathematics , To instruct her fully in those sciences , Whereof I know she is not ignorant . *stop*
Accept of him , or else you do me wrong- His name is Licio , born in Mantua . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Y'are welcome , sir , and he for your good sake ; But for my daughter Katherine , this I know , She is not for your turn , the more my grief . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I see you do not mean to part with her ; Or else you like not of my company . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Mistake me not ; I speak but as I find . *stop*
Whence are you , sir ? *stop*
What may I call your name ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Petruchio is my name , Antonio 's son , A man well known throughout all Italy . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
I know him well ; you are welcome for his sake . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Saving your tale , Petruchio , I pray , Let us that are poor petitioners speak too . *stop*
Bacare ! *stop*
you are marvellous forward . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
O , pardon me , Signior Gremio ! *stop*
I would fain be doing . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
I doubt it not , sir ; but you will curse your wooing . *stop*
Neighbour , this is a gift very grateful , I am sure of it . *stop*
To express the like kindness , myself , that have been more kindly beholding to you than any , freely give unto you this young scholar [ Presenting LUCENTIO ] that hath been long studying at Rheims ; as cunning in Greek , Latin , and other languages , as the other in music and mathematics . *stop*
His name is Cambio . *stop*
Pray accept his service . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
A thousand thanks , Signior Gremio . *stop*
Welcome , good Cambio . *stop*
[ To TRANIO ] But , gentle sir , methinks you walk like a stranger . *stop*
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Pardon me , sir , the boldness is mine own That , being a stranger in this city here , Do make myself a suitor to your daughter , Unto Bianca , fair and virtuous . *stop*
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me In the preferment of the eldest sister . *stop*
This liberty is all that I request- That , upon knowledge of my parentage , I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo , And free access and favour as the rest . *stop*
And toward the education of your daughters I here bestow a simple instrument , And this small packet of Greek and Latin books . *stop*
If you accept them , then their worth is great . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Lucentio is your name ? *stop*
Of whence , I pray ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Of Pisa , sir ; son to Vincentio . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
A mighty man of Pisa . *stop*
By report I know him well . *stop*
You are very welcome , sir . *stop*
Take you the lute , and you the set of books ; You shall go see your pupils presently . *stop*
Holla , within ! *stop*
Enter a SERVANT Sirrah , lead these gentlemen To my daughters ; and tell them both These are their tutors . *stop*
Bid them use them well . *stop*
Exit SERVANT leading HORTENSIO carrying the lute and LUCENTIO with the books We will go walk a little in the orchard , And then to dinner . *stop*
You are passing welcome , And so I pray you all to think yourselves . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Signior Baptista , my business asketh haste , And every day I can not come to woo . *stop*
You knew my father well , and in him me , Left solely heir to all his lands and goods , Which I have bettered rather than decreas 'd . *stop*
Then tell me , if I get your daughter 's love , What dowry shall I have with her to wife ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
After my death , the one half of my lands And , in possession , twenty thousand crowns . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
And for that dowry , I 'll assure her of Her widowhood , be it that she survive me , In all my lands and leases whatsoever . *stop*
Let specialities be therefore drawn between us , That covenants may be kept on either hand . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Ay , when the special thing is well obtain 'd , That is , her love ; for that is all in all . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , that is nothing ; for I tell you , father , I am as peremptory as she proud-minded ; And where two raging fires meet together , They do consume the thing that feeds their fury . *stop*
Though little fire grows great with little wind , Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all . *stop*
So I to her , and so she yields to me ; For I am rough , and woo not like a babe . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed But be thou arm 'd for some unhappy words . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Ay , to the proof , as mountains are for winds , That shake not though they blow perpetually . *stop*
Re-enter HORTENSIO , with his head broke BAPTISTA . *stop*
How now , my friend ! *stop*
Why dost thou look so pale ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
For fear , I promise you , if I look pale . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
What , will my daughter prove a good musician ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
I think she 'll sooner prove a soldier : Iron may hold with her , but never lutes . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Why , no ; for she hath broke the lute to me . *stop*
I did but tell her she mistook her frets , And bow 'd her hand to teach her fingering , When , with a most impatient devilish spirit , 'Frets , call you these ? ' *stop*
quoth she ' I 'll fume with them . ' *stop*
And with that word she struck me on the head , And through the instrument my pate made way ; And there I stood amazed for a while , As on a pillory , looking through the lute , While she did call me rascal fiddler And twangling Jack , with twenty such vile terms , As she had studied to misuse me so . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Now , by the world , it is a lusty wench ; I love her ten times more than e'er I did . *stop*
O , how I long to have some chat with her ! *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Well , go with me , and be not so discomfited ; Proceed in practice with my younger daughter ; She 's apt to learn , and thankful for good turns . *stop*
Signior Petruchio , will you go with us , Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I pray you do . *stop*
Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO I 'll attend her here , And woo her with some spirit when she comes . *stop*
Say that she rail ; why , then I 'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale . *stop*
Say that she frown ; I 'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly wash 'd with dew . *stop*
Say she be mute , and will not speak a word ; Then I 'll commend her volubility , And say she uttereth piercing eloquence . *stop*
If she do bid me pack , I 'll give her thanks , As though she bid me stay by her a week ; If she deny to wed , I 'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns , and when be married . *stop*
But here she comes ; and now , Petruchio , speak . *stop*
Enter KATHERINA Good morrow , Kate- for that 's your name , I hear . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Well have you heard , but something hard of hearing : They call me Katherine that do talk of me . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
You lie , in faith , for you are call 'd plain Kate , And bonny Kate , and sometimes Kate the curst ; But , Kate , the prettiest Kate in Christendom , Kate of Kate Hall , my super-dainty Kate , For dainties are all Kates , and therefore , Kate , Take this of me , Kate of my consolation- Hearing thy mildness prais 'd in every town , Thy virtues spoke of , and thy beauty sounded , Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs , Myself am mov 'd to woo thee for my wife . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Mov 'd ! *stop*
in good time ! *stop*
Let him that mov 'd you hither Remove you hence . *stop*
I knew you at the first You were a moveable . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , what 's a moveable ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
A join'd-stool . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Thou hast hit it . *stop*
Come , sit on me . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Asses are made to bear , and so are you . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Women are made to bear , and so are you . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
No such jade as you , if me you mean . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Alas , good Kate , I will not burden thee ! *stop*
For , knowing thee to be but young and light- KATHERINA . *stop*
Too light for such a swain as you to catch ; And yet as heavy as my weight should be . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Should be ! *stop*
should- buzz ! *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Well ta'en , and like a buzzard . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
O , slow-wing 'd turtle , shall a buzzard take thee ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Ay , for a turtle , as he takes a buzzard . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Come , come , you wasp ; i ' faith , you are too angry . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
If I be waspish , best beware my sting . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
My remedy is then to pluck it out . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Ay , if the fool could find it where it lies . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ? *stop*
In his tail . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
In his tongue . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Whose tongue ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Yours , if you talk of tales ; and so farewell . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
What , with my tongue in your tail ? *stop*
Nay , come again , Good Kate ; I am a gentleman . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
That I 'll try . *stop*
[ She strikes him ] PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I swear I 'll cuff you , if you strike again . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
So may you lose your arms . *stop*
If you strike me , you are no gentleman ; And if no gentleman , why then no arms . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
A herald , Kate ? *stop*
O , put me in thy books ! *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
What is your crest- a coxcomb ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
A combless cock , so Kate will be my hen . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
No cock of mine : you crow too like a craven . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Nay , come , Kate , come ; you must not look so sour . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
It is my fashion , when I see a crab . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , here 's no crab ; and therefore look not sour . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
There is , there is . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Then show it me . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Had I a glass I would . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
What , you mean my face ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Well aim 'd of such a young one . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Now , by Saint George , I am too young for you . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Yet you are wither 'd . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
'T is with cares . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I care not . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Nay , hear you , Kate- in sooth , you scape not so . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I chafe you , if I tarry ; let me go . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
No , not a whit ; I find you passing gentle . *stop*
'T was told me you were rough , and coy , and sullen , And now I find report a very liar ; For thou art pleasant , gamesome , passing courteous , But slow in speech , yet sweet as springtime flowers . *stop*
Thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , Nor bite the lip , as angry wenches will , Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk ; But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers ; With gentle conference , soft and affable . *stop*
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp ? *stop*
O sland'rous world ! *stop*
Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender , and as brown in hue As hazel-nuts , and sweeter than the kernels . *stop*
O , let me see thee walk . *stop*
Thou dost not halt . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Go , fool , and whom thou keep'st command . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait ? *stop*
O , be thou Dian , and let her be Kate ; And then let Kate be chaste , and Dian sportful ! *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Where did you study all this goodly speech ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
It is extempore , from my mother wit . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
A witty mother ! *stop*
witless else her son . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Am I not wise ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Yes , keep you warm . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Marry , so I mean , sweet Katherine , in thy bed . *stop*
And therefore , setting all this chat aside , Thus in plain terms : your father hath consented That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on ; And will you , nill you , I will marry you . *stop*
Now , Kate , I am a husband for your turn ; For , by this light , whereby I see thy beauty , Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well , Thou must be married to no man but me ; For I am he am born to tame you , Kate , And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates . *stop*
Re-enter BAPTISTA , GREMIO , and TRANIO Here comes your father . *stop*
Never make denial ; I must and will have Katherine to my wife . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Now , Signior Petruchio , how speed you with my daughter ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
How but well , sir ? *stop*
how but well ? *stop*
It were impossible I should speed amiss . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Why , how now , daughter Katherine , in your dumps ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Call you me daughter ? *stop*
Now I promise you You have show 'd a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic , A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack , That thinks with oaths to face the matter out . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Father , 't is thus : yourself and all the world That talk 'd of her have talk 'd amiss of her . *stop*
If she be curst , it is for policy , For , she 's not froward , but modest as the dove ; She is not hot , but temperate as the morn ; For patience she will prove a second Grissel , And Roman Lucrece for her chastity . *stop*
And , to conclude , we have 'greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding-day . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I 'll see thee hang 'd on Sunday first . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Hark , Petruchio ; she says she 'll see thee hang 'd first . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Is this your speeding ? *stop*
Nay , then good-night our part ! *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Be patient , gentlemen . *stop*
I choose her for myself ; If she and I be pleas 'd , what 's that to you ? *stop*
'T is bargain 'd 'twixt us twain , being alone , That she shall still be curst in company . *stop*
I tell you 't is incredible to believe . *stop*
How much she loves me- O , the kindest Kate ! *stop*
She hung about my neck , and kiss on kiss She vied so fast , protesting oath on oath , That in a twink she won me to her love . *stop*
O , you are novices ! *stop*
'T is a world to see , How tame , when men and women are alone , A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew . *stop*
Give me thy hand , Kate ; I will unto Venice , To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day . *stop*
Provide the feast , father , and bid the guests ; I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
I know not what to say ; but give me your hands . *stop*
God send you joy , Petruchio ! *stop*
'T is a match . *stop*
GREMIO , TRANIO . *stop*
Amen , say we ; we will be witnesses . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Father , and wife , and gentlemen , adieu . *stop*
I will to Venice ; Sunday comes apace ; We will have rings and things , and fine array ; And kiss me , Kate ; we will be married a Sunday . *stop*
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally GREMIO . *stop*
Was ever match clapp 'd up so suddenly ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Faith , gentlemen , now I play a merchant 's part , And venture madly on a desperate mart . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
'T was a commodity lay fretting by you ; 'Twill bring you gain , or perish on the seas . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
The gain I seek is quiet in the match . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch . *stop*
But now , Baptista , to your younger daughter : Now is the day we long have looked for ; I am your neighbour , and was suitor first . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Youngling , thou canst not love so dear as I. TRANIO . *stop*
Greybeard , thy love doth freeze . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
But thine doth fry . *stop*
Skipper , stand back ; 't is age that nourisheth . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
But youth in ladies ' eyes that flourisheth . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Content you , gentlemen ; I will compound this strife . *stop*
'T is deeds must win the prize , and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca 's love . *stop*
Say , Signior Gremio , what can you assure her ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
First , as you know , my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold , Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands ; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry ; In ivory coffers I have stuff 'd my crowns ; In cypress chests my arras counterpoints , Costly apparel , tents , and canopies , Fine linen , Turkey cushions boss 'd with pearl , Valance of Venice gold in needle-work ; Pewter and brass , and all things that belongs To house or housekeeping . *stop*
Then at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail , Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls , And all things answerable to this portion . *stop*
Myself am struck in years , I must confess ; And if I die to-morrow this is hers , If whilst I live she will be only mine . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
That 'only ' came well in . *stop*
Sir , list to me : I am my father 's heir and only son ; If I may have your daughter to my wife , I 'll leave her houses three or four as good Within rich Pisa 's walls as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua ; Besides two thousand ducats by the year Of fruitful land , all which shall be her jointure . *stop*
What , have I pinch 'd you , Signior Gremio ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Two thousand ducats by the year of land ! *stop*
[ Aside ] My land amounts not to so much in all.- That she shall have , besides an argosy That now is lying in Marseilles road . *stop*
What , have I chok 'd you with an argosy ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Gremio , 't is known my father hath no less Than three great argosies , besides two galliasses , And twelve tight galleys . *stop*
These I will assure her , And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Nay , I have off'red all ; I have no more ; And she can have no more than all I have ; If you like me , she shall have me and mine . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Why , then the maid is mine from all the world By your firm promise ; Gremio is out-vied . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
I must confess your offer is the best ; And let your father make her the assurance , She is your own . *stop*
Else , you must pardon me ; If you should die before him , where 's her dower ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
That 's but a cavil ; he is old , I young . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
And may not young men die as well as old ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Well , gentlemen , I am thus resolv 'd : on Sunday next you know My daughter Katherine is to be married ; Now , on the Sunday following shall Bianca Be bride to you , if you make this assurance ; If not , to Signior Gremio . *stop*
And so I take my leave , and thank you both . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Adieu , good neighbour . *stop*
Exit BAPTISTA Now , I fear thee not . *stop*
Sirrah young gamester , your father were a fool To give thee all , and in his waning age Set foot under thy table . *stop*
Tut , a toy ! *stop*
An old Italian fox is not so kind , my boy . *stop*
Exit TRANIO . *stop*
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide ! *stop*
Yet I have fac 'd it with a card of ten . *stop*
'T is in my head to do my master good : I see no reason but suppos 'd Lucentio Must get a father , call 'd suppos 'd Vincentio ; And that 's a wonder- fathers commonly Do get their children ; but in this case of wooing A child shall get a sire , if I fail not of my cunning . *stop*

SCENE I. Padua . *stop*
BAPTISTA 'S house Enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO , HORTENSIO as LICIO , and BIANCA LUCENTIO . *stop*
Fiddler , forbear ; you grow too forward , sir . *stop*
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katherine welcome 'd you withal ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
But , wrangling pedant , this is The patroness of heavenly harmony . *stop*
Then give me leave to have prerogative ; And when in music we have spent an hour , Your lecture shall have leisure for as much . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Preposterous ass , that never read so far To know the cause why music was ordain 'd ! *stop*
Was it not to refresh the mind of man After his studies or his usual pain ? *stop*
Then give me leave to read philosophy , And while I pause serve in your harmony . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Sirrah , I will not bear these braves of thine . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Why , gentlemen , you do me double wrong To strive for that which resteth in my choice . *stop*
I arn no breeching scholar in the schools , I 'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times , But learn my lessons as I please myself . *stop*
And to cut off all strife : here sit we down ; Take you your instrument , play you the whiles ! *stop*
His lecture will be done ere you have tun 'd . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
You 'll leave his lecture when I am in tune ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
That will be never- tune your instrument . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Where left we last ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Here , madam : 'Hic ibat Simois , hic est Sigeia tellus , Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis . ' *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Construe them . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
'Hic ibat ' as I told you before- 'Simois ' I am Lucentio- 'hic est ' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus' disguised thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat ' and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing- 'Priami ' is my man Tranio- 'regia ' bearing my port- 'celsa senis ' that we might beguile the old pantaloon . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Madam , my instrument 's in tune . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Let 's hear . *stop*
O fie ! *stop*
the treble jars . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Spit in the hole , man , and tune again . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Now let me see if I can construe it : 'Hic ibat Simois' I know you not- 'hic est Sigeia tellus ' I trust you not- 'Hic steterat Priami ' take heed he hear us not- 'regia ' presume not- 'celsa senis ' despair not . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Madam , 't is now in tune . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
All but the bass . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
The bass is right ; 't is the base knave that jars . *stop*
[ Aside ] How fiery and forward our pedant is ! *stop*
Now , for my life , the knave doth court my love . *stop*
Pedascule , I 'll watch you better yet . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
In time I may believe , yet I mistrust . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Mistrust it not- for sure , AEacides Was Ajax , call 'd so from his grandfather . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
I must believe my master ; else , I promise you , I should be arguing still upon that doubt ; But let it rest . *stop*
Now , Licio , to you . *stop*
Good master , take it not unkindly , pray , That I have been thus pleasant with you both . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
[ To LUCENTIO ] You may go walk and give me leave awhile ; My lessons make no music in three Parts . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Are you so formal , sir ? *stop*
Well , I must wait , [ Aside ] And watch withal ; for , but I be deceiv 'd , Our fine musician groweth amorous . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Madam , before you touch the instrument To learn the order of my fingering , I must begin with rudiments of art , To teach you gamut in a briefer sort , More pleasant , pithy , and effectual , Than hath been taught by any of my trade ; And there it is in writing fairly drawn . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Why , I am past my gamut long ago . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
[ Reads ] ' '' Gamut '' I am , the ground of all accord- `` A re '' to plead Hortensio 's passion- `` B mi '' Bianca , take him for thy lord- `` C fa ut '' that loves with all affection- `` D sol re '' one clef , two notes have I- `` E la mi '' show pity or I die . ' *stop*
Call you this gamut ? *stop*
Tut , I like it not ! *stop*
Old fashions please me best ; I am not so nice To change true rules for odd inventions . *stop*
Enter a SERVANT SERVANT . *stop*
Mistress , your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister 's chamber up . *stop*
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Farewell , sweet masters , both ; I must be gone . *stop*
Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT LUCENTIO . *stop*
Faith , mistress , then I have no cause to stay . *stop*
Exit HORTENSIO . *stop*
But I have cause to pry into this pedant ; Methinks he looks as though he were in love . *stop*
Yet if thy thoughts , Bianca , be so humble To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale- Seize thee that list . *stop*
If once I find thee ranging , HORTENSIO will be quit with thee by changing . *stop*
Exit SCENE II . *stop*
Padua . *stop*
Before BAPTISTA 'S house Enter BAPTISTA , GREMIO , TRANIO as LUCENTIO , KATHERINA , BIANCA , LUCENTIO as CAMBIO , and ATTENDANTS BAPTISTA . *stop*
[ To TRANIO ] Signior Lucentio , this is the 'pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married , And yet we hear not of our son-in-law . *stop*
What will be said ? *stop*
What mockery will it be To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage ! *stop*
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
No shame but mine ; I must , forsooth , be forc'd To give my hand , oppos 'd against my heart , Unto a mad-brain rudesby , full of spleen , Who woo 'd in haste and means to wed at leisure . *stop*
I told you , I , he was a frantic fool , Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour ; And , to be noted for a merry man , He 'll woo a thousand , 'point the day of marriage , Make friends invited , and proclaim the banns ; Yet never means to wed where he hath woo 'd . *stop*
Now must the world point at poor Katherine , And say 'Lo , there is mad Petruchio 's wife , If it would please him come and marry her ! ' *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Patience , good Katherine , and Baptista too . *stop*
Upon my life , Petruchio means but well , Whatever fortune stays him from his word . *stop*
Though he be blunt , I know him passing wise ; Though he be merry , yet withal he 's honest . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Would Katherine had never seen him though ! *stop*
Exit , weeping , followed by BIANCA and others BAPTISTA . *stop*
Go , girl , I can not blame thee now to weep , For such an injury would vex a very saint ; Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour . *stop*
Enter BIONDELLO Master , master ! *stop*
News , and such old news as you never heard of ! *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Is it new and old too ? *stop*
How may that be ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Why , is it not news to hear of Petruchio 's coming ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Is he come ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Why , no , sir . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
What then ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
He is coming . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
When will he be here ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
When he stands where I am and sees you there . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
But , say , what to thine old news ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Why , Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old jerkin ; a pair of old breeches thrice turn 'd ; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases , one buckled , another lac 'd ; an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury , with a broken hilt , and chapeless ; with two broken points ; his horse hipp 'd , with an old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred ; besides , possess'd with the glanders and like to mose in the chine , troubled with the lampass , infected with the fashions , full of windgalls , sped with spavins , rayed with the yellows , past cure of the fives , stark spoil 'd with the staggers , begnawn with the bots , sway 'd in the back and shoulder-shotten , near-legg 'd before , and with a half-cheek 'd bit , and a head-stall of sheep 's leather which , being restrained to keep him from stumbling , hath been often burst , and now repaired with knots ; one girth six times piec 'd , and a woman 's crupper of velure , which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs , and here and there piec 'd with pack-thread . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Who comes with him ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
O , sir , his lackey , for all the world caparison'd like the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other , gart'red with a red and blue list ; an old hat , and the humour of forty fancies prick 'd i n't for a feather ; a monster , a very monster in apparel , and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman 's lackey . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
'T is some odd humour pricks him to this fashion ; Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell 'd . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
I am glad he 's come , howsoe'er he comes . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Why , sir , he comes not . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Didst thou not say he comes ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Who ? *stop*
that Petruchio came ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Ay , that Petruchio came . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
No , sir ; I say his horse comes with him on his back . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Why , that 's all one . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Nay , by Saint Jamy , I hold you a penny , A horse and a man Is more than one , And yet not many . *stop*
Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Come , where be these gallants ? *stop*
Who 's at home ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
You are welcome , sir . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
And yet I come not well . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
And yet you halt not . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Not so well apparell'd As I wish you were . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Were it better , I should rush in thus . *stop*
But where is Kate ? *stop*
Where is my lovely bride ? *stop*
How does my father ? *stop*
Gentles , methinks you frown ; And wherefore gaze this goodly company As if they saw some wondrous monument , Some comet or unusual prodigy ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding-day . *stop*
First were we sad , fearing you would not come ; Now sadder , that you come so unprovided . *stop*
Fie , doff this habit , shame to your estate , An eye-sore to our solemn festival ! *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detain 'd you from your wife , And sent you hither so unlike yourself ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Tedious it were to tell , and harsh to hear ; Sufficeth I am come to keep my word , Though in some part enforced to digress , Which at more leisure I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal . *stop*
But where is Kate ? *stop*
I stay too long from her ; The morning wears , 't is time we were at church . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
See not your bride in these unreverent robes ; Go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Not I , believe me ; thus I 'll visit her . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
But thus , I trust , you will not marry her . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Good sooth , even thus ; therefore ha ' done with words ; To me she 's married , not unto my clothes . *stop*
Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements , 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself . *stop*
But what a fool am I to chat with you , When I should bid good-morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss ! *stop*
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO TRANIO . *stop*
He hath some meaning in his mad attire . *stop*
We will persuade him , be it possible , To put on better ere he go to church . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
I 'll after him and see the event of this . *stop*
Exeunt BAPTISTA , GREMIO , BIONDELLO , and ATTENDENTS TRANIO . *stop*
But to her love concerneth us to ad Her father 's liking ; which to bring to pass , As I before imparted to your worship , I am to get a man- whate'er he be It skills not much ; we 'll fit him to our turn- And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa , And make assurance here in Padua Of greater sums than I have promised . *stop*
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca 's steps so narrowly , 'Twere good , methinks , to steal our marriage ; Which once perform 'd , let all the world say no , I 'll keep mine own despite of all the world . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business ; We 'll over-reach the greybeard , Gremio , The narrow-prying father , Minola , The quaint musician , amorous Licio- All for my master 's sake , Lucentio . *stop*
Re-enter GREMIO Signior Gremio , came you from the church ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
As willingly as e'er I came from school . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
A bridegroom , say you ? *stop*
'T is a groom indeed , A grumbling groom , and that the girl shall find . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Curster than she ? *stop*
Why , 't is impossible . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Why , he 's a devil , a devil , a very fiend . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Why , she 's a devil , a devil , the devil 's dam . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Tut , she 's a lamb , a dove , a fool , to him ! *stop*
I 'll tell you , Sir Lucentio : when the priest Should ask if Katherine should be his wife , 'Ay , by gogs-wouns ' quoth he , and swore so loud That , all amaz 'd , the priest let fall the book ; And as he stoop 'd again to take it up , This mad-brain 'd bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book , and book and priest . *stop*
'Now take them up , ' quoth he 'if any list . ' *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
What said the wench , when he rose again ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Trembled and shook , for why he stamp 'd and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him . *stop*
But after many ceremonies done He calls for wine : ' A health ! ' *stop*
quoth he , as if He had been abroad , carousing to his mates After a storm ; quaff 'd off the muscadel , And threw the sops all in the sexton 's face , Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seem 'd to ask him sops as he was drinking . *stop*
This done , he took the bride about the neck , And kiss 'd her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo . *stop*
And I , seeing this , came thence for very shame ; And after me , I know , the rout is coming . *stop*
Such a mad marriage never was before . *stop*
Hark , hark ! *stop*
I hear the minstrels play . *stop*
[ Music plays ] Enter PETRUCHIO , KATHERINA , BIANCA , BAPTISTA , HORTENSIO , GRUMIO , and train PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Gentlemen and friends , I thank you for your pains . *stop*
I know you think to dine with me to-day , And have prepar 'd great store of wedding cheer But so it is- my haste doth call me hence , And therefore here I mean to take my leave . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Is't possible you will away to-night ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I must away to-day before night come . *stop*
Make it no wonder ; if you knew my business , You would entreat me rather go than stay . *stop*
And , honest company , I thank you all That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient , sweet , and virtuous wife . *stop*
Dine with my father , drink a health to me . *stop*
For I must hence ; and farewell to you all . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner . *stop*

Let me entreat you . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I am content . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Are you content to stay ? *stop*

I am content you shall entreat me stay ; But yet not stay , entreat me how you can . *stop*

Now , if you love me , stay . *stop*

Grumio , my horse . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Ay , sir , they be ready ; the oats have eaten the horses . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Nay , then , Do what thou canst , I will not go to-day ; No , nor to-morrow , not till I please myself . *stop*
The door is open , sir ; there lies your way ; You may be jogging whiles your boots are green ; For me , I 'll not be gone till I please myself . *stop*
'T is like you 'll prove a jolly surly groom That take it on you at the first so roundly . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
O Kate , content thee ; prithee be not angry . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I will be angry ; what hast thou to do ? *stop*
Father , be quiet ; he shall stay my leisure . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Ay , marry , sir , now it begins to work . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Gentlemen , forward to the bridal dinner . *stop*
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
They shall go forward , Kate , at thy command . *stop*
Obey the bride , you that attend on her ; Go to the feast , revel and domineer , Carouse full measure to her maidenhead ; Be mad and merry , or go hang yourselves . *stop*
But for my bonny Kate , she must with me . *stop*
Nay , look not big , nor stamp , nor stare , nor fret ; I will be master of what is mine own- She is my goods , my chattels , she is my house , My household stuff , my field , my barn , My horse , my ox , my ass , my any thing , And here she stands ; touch her whoever dare ; I 'll bring mine action on the proudest he That stops my way in Padua . *stop*
Grumio , Draw forth thy weapon ; we are beset with thieves ; Rescue thy mistress , if thou be a man . *stop*
Fear not , sweet wench ; they shall not touch thee , Kate ; I 'll buckler thee against a million . *stop*
Exeunt PETRUCHIO , KATHERINA , and GRUMIO BAPTISTA . *stop*
Nay , let them go , a couple of quiet ones . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Went they not quickly , I should die with laughing . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Of all mad matches , never was the like . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Mistress , what 's your opinion of your sister ? *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
That , being mad herself , she 's madly mated . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
I warrant him , Petruchio is Kated . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Neighbours and friends , though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table , You know there wants no junkets at the feast . *stop*
Lucentio , you shall supply the bridegroom 's place ; And let Bianca take her sister 's room . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
She shall , Lucentio . *stop*

SCENE I. PETRUCHIO 'S country house Enter GRUMIO GRUMIO . *stop*
Fie , fie on all tired jades , on all mad masters , and all foul ways ! *stop*
Was ever man so beaten ? *stop*
Was ever man so ray 'd ? *stop*
Was ever man so weary ? *stop*
I am sent before to make a fire , and they are coming after to warm them . *stop*
Now were not I a little pot and soon hot , my very lips might freeze to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , my heart in my belly , ere I should come by a fire to thaw me . *stop*
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself ; for , considering the weather , a taller man than I will take cold . *stop*
Holla , ho ! *stop*
Curtis ! *stop*
Enter CURTIS CURTIS . *stop*
Who is that calls so coldly ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
A piece of ice . *stop*
If thou doubt it , thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck . *stop*
A fire , good Curtis . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Is my master and his wife coming , Grumio ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
O , ay , Curtis , ay ; and therefore fire , fire ; cast on no water . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Is she so hot a shrew as she 's reported ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
She was , good Curtis , before this frost ; but thou know'st winter tames man , woman , and beast ; for it hath tam 'd my old master , and my new mistress , and myself , fellow Curtis . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Away , you three-inch fool ! *stop*
I am no beast . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Am I but three inches ? *stop*
Why , thy horn is a foot , and so long am I at the least . *stop*
But wilt thou make a fire , or shall I complain on thee to our mistress , whose hand- she being now at hand- thou shalt soon feel , to thy cold comfort , for being slow in thy hot office ? *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
I prithee , good Grumio , tell me how goes the world ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
A cold world , Curtis , in every office but thine ; and therefore fire . *stop*
Do thy duty , and have thy duty , for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
There 's fire ready ; and therefore , good Grumio , the news ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Why , 'Jack boy ! *stop*
ho , boy ! ' *stop*
and as much news as thou wilt . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Come , you are so full of cony-catching ! *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Why , therefore , fire ; for I have caught extreme cold . *stop*
Where 's the cook ? *stop*
Is supper ready , the house trimm 'd , rushes strew 'd , cobwebs swept , the serving-men in their new fustian , their white stockings , and every officer his wedding-garment on ? *stop*
Be the jacks fair within , the jills fair without , the carpets laid , and everything in order ? *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
All ready ; and therefore , I pray thee , news . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
First know my horse is tired ; my master and mistress fall ' n out . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
How ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Out of their saddles into the dirt ; and thereby hangs a tale . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Let 's ha't , good Grumio . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Lend thine ear . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Here . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
There . *stop*
[ Striking him ] CURTIS . *stop*
This 't is to feel a tale , not to hear a tale . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
And therefore 't is call 'd a sensible tale ; and this cuff was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning . *stop*
Now I begin : Imprimis , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress- CURTIS . *stop*
Both of one horse ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
What 's that to thee ? *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Why , a horse . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Tell thou the tale . *stop*
But hadst thou not cross 'd me , thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse ; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place , how she was bemoil 'd , how he left her with the horse upon her , how he beat me because her horse stumbled , how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me , how he swore , how she pray 'd that never pray'd before , how I cried , how the horses ran away , how her bridle was burst , how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy memory , which now shall die in oblivion , and thou return unexperienc 'd to thy grave . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Ay , and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home . *stop*
But what talk I of this ? *stop*
Call forth Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest ; let their heads be sleekly comb 'd , their blue coats brush'd and their garters of an indifferent knit ; let them curtsy with their left legs , and not presume to touch a hair of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their hands . *stop*
Are they all ready ? *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
They are . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Call them forth . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Do you hear , ho ? *stop*
You must meet my master , to countenance my mistress . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Why , she hath a face of her own . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
Who knows not that ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Thou , it seems , that calls for company to countenance her . *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
I call them forth to credit her . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Why , she comes to borrow nothing of them . *stop*
Enter four or five SERVINGMEN NATHANIEL . *stop*
Welcome home , Grumio ! *stop*
PHILIP . *stop*
How now , Grumio ! *stop*
JOSEPH . *stop*
What , Grumio ! *stop*
NICHOLAS . *stop*
Fellow Grumio ! *stop*
NATHANIEL . *stop*
How now , old lad ! *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Welcome , you ! - how now , you ! - what , you ! - fellow , you ! - and thus much for greeting . *stop*
Now , my spruce companions , is all ready , and all things neat ? *stop*
NATHANIEL . *stop*
All things is ready . *stop*
How near is our master ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
E'en at hand , alighted by this ; and therefore be not- Cock 's passion , silence ! *stop*
I hear my master . *stop*
Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Where be these knaves ? *stop*
What , no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse ! *stop*
Where is Nathaniel , Gregory , Philip ? *stop*
ALL SERVANTS . *stop*
Here , here , sir ; here , sir . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Here , sir ! *stop*
here , sir ! *stop*
here , sir ! *stop*
here , sir ! *stop*
You logger-headed and unpolish 'd grooms ! *stop*
What , no attendance ? *stop*
no regard ? *stop*
no duty ? *stop*
Where is the foolish knave I sent before ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Here , sir ; as foolish as I was before . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
YOU peasant swain ! *stop*
you whoreson malt-horse drudge ! *stop*
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Nathaniel 's coat , sir , was not fully made , And Gabriel 's pumps were all unpink 'd i ' th ' heel ; There was no link to colour Peter 's hat , And Walter 's dagger was not come from sheathing ; There were none fine but Adam , Ralph , and Gregory ; The rest were ragged , old , and beggarly ; Yet , as they are , here are they come to meet you . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Go , rascals , go and fetch my supper in . *stop*
Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN [ Sings ] Where is the life that late I led ? *stop*
Where are those- Sit down , Kate , and welcome . *stop*
Soud , soud , soud , soud ! *stop*
Re-enter SERVANTS with supper Why , when , I say ? *stop*
Nay , good sweet Kate , be merry . *stop*
Off with my boots , you rogues ! *stop*
you villains , when ? *stop*
[ Sings ] It was the friar of orders grey , As he forth walked on his way- Out , you rogue ! *stop*
you pluck my foot awry ; Take that , and mend the plucking off the other . *stop*
[ Strikes him ] Be merry , Kate . *stop*
Some water , here , what , ho ! *stop*
Enter one with water Where 's my spaniel Troilus ? *stop*
Sirrah , get you hence , And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither : Exit SERVINGMAN One , Kate , that you must kiss and be acquainted with . *stop*
Where are my slippers ? *stop*
Shall I have some water ? *stop*
Come , Kate , and wash , and welcome heartily . *stop*
You whoreson villain ! *stop*
will you let it fall ? *stop*
[ Strikes him ] KATHERINA . *stop*
Patience , I pray you ; 't was a fault unwilling . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
A whoreson , beetle-headed , flap-ear 'd knave ! *stop*
Come , Kate , sit down ; I know you have a stomach . *stop*
Will you give thanks , sweet Kate , or else shall I ? *stop*
What 's this ? *stop*
Mutton ? *stop*
FIRST SERVANT . *stop*
Ay . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Who brought it ? *stop*
PETER . *stop*
I. PETRUCHIO . *stop*
'T is burnt ; and so is all the meat . *stop*
What dogs are these ? *stop*
Where is the rascal cook ? *stop*
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not ? *stop*
There , take it to you , trenchers , cups , and all ; [ Throws the meat , etc. , at them ] You heedless joltheads and unmanner 'd slaves ! *stop*
What , do you grumble ? *stop*
I 'll be with you straight . *stop*
Exeunt SERVANTS KATHERINA . *stop*
I pray you , husband , be not so disquiet ; The meat was well , if you were so contented . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I tell thee , Kate , 't was burnt and dried away , And I expressly am forbid to touch it ; For it engenders choler , planteth anger ; And better 'twere that both of us did fast , Since , of ourselves , ourselves are choleric , Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh . *stop*
Be patient ; to-morrow 't shall be mended . *stop*
And for this night we 'll fast for company . *stop*
Come , I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber . *stop*
Exeunt Re-enter SERVANTS severally NATHANIEL . *stop*
Peter , didst ever see the like ? *stop*
PETER . *stop*
He kills her in her own humour . *stop*
Re-enter CURTIS GRUMIO . *stop*
Where is he ? *stop*
CURTIS . *stop*
In her chamber . *stop*
Making a sermon of continency to her , And rails , and swears , and rates , that she , poor soul , Knows not which way to stand , to look , to speak . *stop*
And sits as one new risen from a dream . *stop*
Away , away ! *stop*
for he is coming hither . *stop*
Exeunt Re-enter PETRUCHIO PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Thus have I politicly begun my reign , And 't is my hope to end successfully . *stop*
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty . *stop*
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg 'd , For then she never looks upon her lure . *stop*
Another way I have to man my haggard , To make her come , and know her keeper 's call , That is , to watch her , as we watch these kites That bate and beat , and will not be obedient . *stop*
She eat no meat to-day , nor none shall eat ; Last night she slept not , nor to-night she shall not ; As with the meat , some undeserved fault I 'll find about the making of the bed ; And here I 'll fling the pillow , there the bolster , This way the coverlet , another way the sheets ; Ay , and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her- And , in conclusion , she shall watch all night ; And if she chance to nod I 'll rail and brawl And with the clamour keep her still awake . *stop*
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness , And thus I 'll curb her mad and headstrong humour . *stop*
He that knows better how to tame a shrew , Now let him speak ; 't is charity to show . *stop*
Exit SCENE II . *stop*
Padua . *stop*
Before BAPTISTA 'S house Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO , and HORTENSIO as LICIO TRANIO . *stop*
Is 't possible , friend Licio , that Mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio ? *stop*
I tell you , sir , she bears me fair in hand . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Sir , to satisfy you in what I have said , Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching . *stop*
[ They stand aside ] Enter BIANCA , and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO LUCENTIO . *stop*
Now , mistress , profit you in what you read ? *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
What , master , read you , First resolve me that . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
I read that I profess , 'The Art to Love . ' *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
And may you prove , sir , master of your art ! *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
While you , sweet dear , prove mistress of my heart . *stop*
[ They retire ] HORTENSIO . *stop*
Quick proceeders , marry ! *stop*
Now tell me , I pray , You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca Lov 'd none in the world so well as Lucentio . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
O despiteful love ! *stop*
unconstant womankind ! *stop*
I tell thee , Licio , this is wonderful . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Mistake no more ; I am not Licio . *stop*
Nor a musician as I seem to be ; But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentleman And makes a god of such a cullion . *stop*
Know , sir , that I am call 'd Hortensio . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Signior Hortensio , I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca ; And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness , I will with you , if you be so contented , Forswear Bianca and her love for ever . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
See , how they kiss and court ! *stop*
Signior Lucentio , Here is my hand , and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more , but do forswear her , As one unworthy all the former favours That I have fondly flatter 'd her withal . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
And here I take the like unfeigned oath , Never to marry with her though she would entreat ; Fie on her ! *stop*
See how beastly she doth court him ! *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn ! *stop*
For me , that I may surely keep mine oath , I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass , which hath as long lov 'd me As I have lov 'd this proud disdainful haggard . *stop*
And so farewell , Signior Lucentio . *stop*
Kindness in women , not their beauteous looks , Shall win my love ; and so I take my leave , In resolution as I swore before . *stop*
Exit TRANIO . *stop*
Mistress Bianca , bless you with such grace As 'longeth to a lover 's blessed case ! *stop*
Nay , I have ta'en you napping , gentle love , And have forsworn you with Hortensio . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Tranio , you jest ; but have you both forsworn me ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Mistress , we have . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Then we are rid of Licio . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
I ' faith , he 'll have a lusty widow now , That shall be woo 'd and wedded in a day . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
God give him joy ! *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Ay , and he 'll tame her . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
He says so , Tranio . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Faith , he is gone unto the taming-school . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
The taming-school ! *stop*
What , is there such a place ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Ay , mistress ; and Petruchio is the master , That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long , To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue . *stop*
Enter BIONDELLO BIONDELLO . *stop*
O master , master , have watch 'd so long That I am dog-weary ; but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
What is he , Biondello ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Master , a mercatante or a pedant , I know not what ; but formal in apparel , In gait and countenance surely like a father . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
And what of him , Tranio ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
If he be credulous and trust my tale , I 'll make him glad to seem Vincentio , And give assurance to Baptista Minola As if he were the right Vincentio . *stop*
Take in your love , and then let me alone . *stop*
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA Enter a PEDANT PEDANT . *stop*
God save you , sir ! *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
And you , sir ; you are welcome . *stop*
Travel you far on , or are you at the farthest ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Sir , at the farthest for a week or two ; But then up farther , and as far as Rome ; And so to Tripoli , if God lend me life . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
What countryman , I pray ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Of Mantua . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Of Mantua , sir ? *stop*
Marry , God forbid , And come to Padua , careless of your life ! *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
My life , sir ! *stop*
How , I pray ? *stop*
For that goes hard . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
'T is death for any one in Mantua To come to Padua . *stop*
Know you not the cause ? *stop*
Your ships are stay 'd at Venice ; and the Duke , For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him , Hath publish 'd and proclaim 'd it openly . *stop*
'T is marvel- but that you are but newly come , You might have heard it else proclaim 'd about . *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Alas , sir , it is worse for me than so ! *stop*
For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence , and must here deliver them . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Well , sir , to do you courtesy , This will I do , and this I will advise you- First , tell me , have you ever been at Pisa ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Ay , sir , in Pisa have I often been , Pisa renowned for grave citizens . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Among them know you one Vincentio ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
I know him not , but I have heard of him , A merchant of incomparable wealth . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
He is my father , sir ; and , sooth to say , In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*

TRANIO . *stop*
To save your life in this extremity , This favour will I do you for his sake ; And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio . *stop*
His name and credit shall you undertake , And in my house you shall be friendly lodg 'd ; Look that you take upon you as you should . *stop*
You understand me , sir . *stop*
So shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city . *stop*
If this be court'sy , sir , accept of it . *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
O , sir , I do ; and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Then go with me to make the matter good . *stop*
This , by the way , I let you understand : My father is here look 'd for every day To pass assurance of a dow ' r in marriage 'Twixt me and one Baptista 's daughter here . *stop*
In all these circumstances I 'll instruct you . *stop*
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you . *stop*
Exeunt SCENE III . *stop*
PETRUCHIO 'S house Enter KATHERINA and GRUMIO GRUMIO . *stop*
No , no , forsooth ; I dare not for my life . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
The more my wrong , the more his spite appears . *stop*
What , did he marry me to famish me ? *stop*
Beggars that come unto my father 's door Upon entreaty have a present alms ; If not , elsewhere they meet with charity ; But I , who never knew how to entreat , Nor never needed that I should entreat , Am starv 'd for meat , giddy for lack of sleep ; With oaths kept waking , and with brawling fed ; And that which spites me more than all these wants- He does it under name of perfect love ; As who should say , if I should sleep or eat , 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death . *stop*
I prithee go and get me some repast ; I care not what , so it be wholesome food . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
What say you to a neat 's foot ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
'T is passing good ; I prithee let me have it . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
I fear it is too choleric a meat . *stop*
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil 'd ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I like it well ; good Grumio , fetch it me . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
I can not tell ; I fear 't is choleric . *stop*
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
A dish that I do love to feed upon . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Ay , but the mustard is too hot a little . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Why then the beef , and let the mustard rest . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Nay , then I will not ; you shall have the mustard , Or else you get no beef of Grumio . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Then both , or one , or anything thou wilt . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Why then the mustard without the beef . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Go , get thee gone , thou false deluding slave , [ Beats him ] That feed'st me with the very name of meat . *stop*
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you That triumph thus upon my misery ! *stop*
Go , get thee gone , I say . *stop*
Enter PETRUCHIO , and HORTENSIO with meat PETRUCHIO . *stop*
How fares my Kate ? *stop*
What , sweeting , all amort ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Mistress , what cheer ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Faith , as cold as can be . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Pluck up thy spirits , look cheerfully upon me . *stop*
Here , love , thou seest how diligent I am , To dress thy meat myself , and bring it thee . *stop*
I am sure , sweet Kate , this kindness merits thanks . *stop*
What , not a word ? *stop*
Nay , then thou lov'st it not , And all my pains is sorted to no proof . *stop*
Here , take away this dish . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I pray you , let it stand . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
The poorest service is repaid with thanks ; And so shall mine , before you touch the meat . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I thank you , sir . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Signior Petruchio , fie ! *stop*
you are to blame . *stop*
Come , Mistress Kate , I 'll bear you company . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
[ Aside ] Eat it up all , Hortensio , if thou lovest me.- Much good do it unto thy gentle heart ! *stop*
Kate , eat apace . *stop*
And now , my honey love , Will we return unto thy father 's house And revel it as bravely as the best , With silken coats and caps , and golden rings , With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things , With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry . *stop*
With amber bracelets , beads , and all this knav'ry . *stop*
What , hast thou din 'd ? *stop*
The tailor stays thy leisure , To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure . *stop*
Enter TAILOR Come , tailor , let us see these ornaments ; Lay forth the gown . *stop*
Enter HABERDASHER What news with you , sir ? *stop*
HABERDASHER . *stop*
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , this was moulded on a porringer ; A velvet dish . *stop*
Fie , fie ! *stop*
't is lewd and filthy ; Why , 't is a cockle or a walnut-shell , A knack , a toy , a trick , a baby 's cap . *stop*
Away with it . *stop*
Come , let me have a bigger . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I 'll have no bigger ; this doth fit the time , And gentlewomen wear such caps as these . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
When you are gentle , you shall have one too , And not till then . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
[ Aside ] That will not be in haste . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Why , sir , I trust I may have leave to speak ; And speak I will . *stop*
I am no child , no babe . *stop*
Your betters have endur 'd me say my mind , And if you can not , best you stop your ears . *stop*
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart , Or else my heart , concealing it , will break ; And rather than it shall , I will be free Even to the uttermost , as I please , in words . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , thou say'st true ; it is a paltry cap , A custard-coffin , a bauble , a silken pie ; I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Love me or love me not , I like the cap ; And it I will have , or I will have none . *stop*
Exit HABERDASHER PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Thy gown ? *stop*
Why , ay . *stop*
Come , tailor , let us see't . *stop*
O mercy , God ! *stop*
what masquing stuff is here ? *stop*
What 's this ? *stop*
A sleeve ? *stop*
'T is like a demi-cannon . *stop*
What , up and down , carv 'd like an appletart ? *stop*
Here 's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash , Like to a censer in a barber 's shop . *stop*
Why , what a devil 's name , tailor , call'st thou this ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
[ Aside ] I see she 's like to have neither cap nor gown . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
You bid me make it orderly and well , According to the fashion and the time . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Marry , and did ; but if you be rememb'red , I did not bid you mar it to the time . *stop*
Go , hop me over every kennel home , For you shall hop without my custom , sir . *stop*
I 'll none of it ; hence ! *stop*
make your best of it . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I never saw a better fashion 'd gown , More quaint , more pleasing , nor more commendable ; Belike you mean to make a puppet of me . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , true ; he means to make a puppet of thee . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
She says your worship means to make a puppet of her . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
O monstrous arrogance ! *stop*
Thou liest , thou thread , thou thimble , Thou yard , three-quarters , half-yard , quarter , nail , Thou flea , thou nit , thou winter-cricket thou- Brav 'd in mine own house with a skein of thread ! *stop*
Away , thou rag , thou quantity , thou remnant ; Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st ! *stop*
I tell thee , I , that thou hast marr 'd her gown . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
Your worship is deceiv 'd ; the gown is made Just as my master had direction . *stop*
Grumio gave order how it should be done . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
I gave him no order ; I gave him the stuff . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
But how did you desire it should be made ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Marry , sir , with needle and thread . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
But did you not request to have it cut ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Thou hast fac 'd many things . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
I have . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Face not me . *stop*
Thou hast brav 'd many men ; brave not me . *stop*
I will neither be fac 'd nor brav 'd . *stop*
I say unto thee , I bid thy master cut out the gown ; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces . *stop*
Ergo , thou liest . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
Why , here is the note of the fashion to testify . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Read it . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
The note lies in 's throat , if he say I said so . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
[ Reads ] 'Imprimis , a loose-bodied gown'- GRUMIO . *stop*
Master , if ever I said loose-bodied gown , sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread ; I said a gown . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Proceed . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
[ Reads ] 'With a small compass 'd cape'- GRUMIO . *stop*
I confess the cape . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
[ Reads ] 'With a trunk sleeve'- GRUMIO . *stop*
I confess two sleeves . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
[ Reads ] 'The sleeves curiously cut . ' *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Ay , there 's the villainy . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Error i ' th ' bill , sir ; error i ' th ' bill ! *stop*
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out , and sew 'd up again ; and that I'll prove upon thee , though thy little finger be armed in a thimble . *stop*
TAILOR . *stop*
This is true that I say ; an I had thee in place where , thou shouldst know it . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
I am for thee straight ; take thou the bill , give me thy meteyard , and spare not me . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
God-a-mercy , Grumio ! *stop*
Then he shall have no odds . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Well , sir , in brief , the gown is not for me . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
You are i ' th ' right , sir ; 't is for my mistress . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Go , take it up unto thy master 's use . *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
Villain , not for thy life ! *stop*
Take up my mistress ' gown for thy master 's use ! *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , sir , what 's your conceit in that ? *stop*
GRUMIO . *stop*
O , sir , the conceit is deeper than you think for . *stop*
Take up my mistress ' gown to his master 's use ! *stop*
O fie , fie , fie ! *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
[ Aside ] Hortensio , say thou wilt see the tailor paid.- Go take it hence ; be gone , and say no more . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Tailor , I 'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow ; Take no unkindness of his hasty words . *stop*
Away , I say ; commend me to thy master . *stop*
Exit TAILOR PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Well , come , my Kate ; we will unto your father's Even in these honest mean habiliments ; Our purses shall be proud , our garments poor ; For 't is the mind that makes the body rich ; And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds , So honour peereth in the meanest habit . *stop*
What , is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful ? *stop*
Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye ? *stop*
O no , good Kate ; neither art thou the worse For this poor furniture and mean array . *stop*
If thou account'st it shame , lay it on me ; And therefore frolic ; we will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father 's house . *stop*
Go call my men , and let us straight to him ; And bring our horses unto Long-lane end ; There will we mount , and thither walk on foot . *stop*
Let 's see ; I think 't is now some seven o'clock , And well we may come there by dinner-time . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I dare assure you , sir , 't is almost two , And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
It shall be seven ere I go to horse . *stop*
Look what I speak , or do , or think to do , You are still crossing it . *stop*
Sirs , let 't alone ; I will not go to-day ; and ere I do , It shall be what o'clock I say it is . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Why , so this gallant will command the sun . *stop*
Exeunt SCENE IV . *stop*
Padua . *stop*
Before BAPTISTA 'S house Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO , and the PEDANT dressed like VINCENTIO TRANIO . *stop*
Sir , this is the house ; please it you that I call ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Ay , what else ? *stop*
And , but I be deceived , Signior Baptista may remember me Near twenty years ago in Genoa , Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
'T is well ; and hold your own , in any case , With such austerity as longeth to a father . *stop*
Enter BIONDELLO PEDANT . *stop*
I warrant you . *stop*
But , sir , here comes your boy ; 'Twere good he were school 'd . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Fear you not him . *stop*
Sirrah Biondello , Now do your duty throughly , I advise you . *stop*
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Tut , fear not me . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
I told him that your father was at Venice , And that you look 'd for him this day in Padua . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Th'art a tall fellow ; hold thee that to drink . *stop*
Here comes Baptista . *stop*
Set your countenance , sir . *stop*
Enter BAPTISTA , and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO Signior Baptista , you are happily met . *stop*
[ To the PEDANT ] Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of ; I pray you stand good father to me now ; Give me Bianca for my patrimony . *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Soft , son ! *stop*
Sir , by your leave : having come to Padua To gather in some debts , my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself ; And- for the good report I hear of you , And for the love he beareth to your daughter , And she to him- to stay him not too long , I am content , in a good father 's care , To have him match 'd ; and , if you please to like No worse than I , upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestow 'd ; For curious I can not be with you , Signior Baptista , of whom I hear so well . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Sir , pardon me in what I have to say . *stop*
Your plainness and your shortness please me well . *stop*
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter , and she loveth him , Or both dissemble deeply their affections ; And therefore , if you say no more than this , That like a father you will deal with him , And pass my daughter a sufficient dower , The match is made , and all is done- Your son shall have my daughter with consent . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
I thank you , sir . *stop*
Where then do you know best We be affied , and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part 's agreement stand ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Not in my house , Lucentio , for you know Pitchers have ears , and I have many servants ; Besides , old Gremio is heark'ning still , And happily we might be interrupted . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Then at my lodging , an it like you . *stop*
There doth my father lie ; and there this night We 'll pass the business privately and well . *stop*
Send for your daughter by your servant here ; My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently . *stop*
The worst is this , that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
It likes me well . *stop*
Cambio , hie you home , And bid Bianca make her ready straight ; And , if you will , tell what hath happened- Lucentio 's father is arriv 'd in Padua , And how she 's like to be Lucentio 's wife . *stop*
Exit LUCENTIO BIONDELLO . *stop*
I pray the gods she may , with all my heart . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Dally not with the gods , but get thee gone . *stop*
Exit BIONDELLO Signior Baptista , shall I lead the way ? *stop*
Welcome ! *stop*
One mess is like to be your cheer ; Come , sir ; we will better it in Pisa . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
I follow you . *stop*
Exeunt Re-enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO , and BIONDELLO BIONDELLO . *stop*
Cambio . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
What say'st thou , Biondello ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Biondello , what of that ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Faith , nothing ; but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
I pray thee moralize them . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Then thus : Baptista is safe , talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
And what of him ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
And then ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
The old priest at Saint Luke 's church is at your command at all hours . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
And what of all this ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
I can not tell , except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance . *stop*
Take your assurance of her , cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum ; to th ' church take the priest , clerk , and some sufficient honest witnesses . *stop*
If this be not that you look for , I have more to say , But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Hear'st thou , Biondello ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
I can not tarry . *stop*
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit ; and so may you , sir ; and so adieu , sir . *stop*
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke 's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix . *stop*
Exit LUCENTIO . *stop*
I may and will , if she be so contented . *stop*
She will be pleas 'd ; then wherefore should I doubt ? *stop*
Hap what hap may , I 'll roundly go about her ; It shall go hard if Cambio go without her . *stop*
Exit SCENE V. A public road Enter PETRUCHIO , KATHERINA , HORTENSIO , and SERVANTS PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Come on , a God 's name ; once more toward our father 's . *stop*
Good Lord , how bright and goodly shines the moon ! *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
The moon ? *stop*
The sun ! *stop*
It is not moonlight now . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I say it is the moon that shines so bright . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I know it is the sun that shines so bright . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Now by my mother 's son , and that 's myself , It shall be moon , or star , or what I list , Or ere I journey to your father 's house . *stop*
Go on and fetch our horses back again . *stop*
Evermore cross 'd and cross 'd ; nothing but cross 'd ! *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Say as he says , or we shall never go . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Forward , I pray , since we have come so far , And be it moon , or sun , or what you please ; And if you please to call it a rush-candle , Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I say it is the moon . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
I know it is the moon . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Nay , then you lie ; it is the blessed sun . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Then , God be bless 'd , it is the blessed sun ; But sun it is not , when you say it is not ; And the moon changes even as your mind . *stop*
What you will have it nam 'd , even that it is , And so it shall be so for Katherine . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Petruchio , go thy ways , the field is won . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Well , forward , forward ! *stop*
thus the bowl should run , And not unluckily against the bias . *stop*
But , soft ! *stop*
Company is coming here . *stop*
Enter VINCENTIO [ To VINCENTIO ] Good-morrow , gentle mistress ; where away ? - Tell me , sweet Kate , and tell me truly too , Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman ? *stop*
Such war of white and red within her cheeks ! *stop*
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty As those two eyes become that heavenly face ? *stop*
Fair lovely maid , once more good day to thee . *stop*
Sweet Kate , embrace her for her beauty 's sake . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
' A will make the man mad , to make a woman of him . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Young budding virgin , fair and fresh and sweet , Whither away , or where is thy abode ? *stop*
Happy the parents of so fair a child ; Happier the man whom favourable stars Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , how now , Kate , I hope thou art not mad ! *stop*
This is a man , old , wrinkled , faded , withered , And not a maiden , as thou sayst he is . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Pardon , old father , my mistaking eyes , That have been so bedazzled with the sun That everything I look on seemeth green ; Now I perceive thou art a reverend father . *stop*
Pardon , I pray thee , for my mad mistaking . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Do , good old grandsire , and withal make known Which way thou travellest- if along with us , We shall be joyful of thy company . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Fair sir , and you my merry mistress , That with your strange encounter much amaz 'd me , My name is call 'd Vincentio , my dwelling Pisa , And bound I am to Padua , there to visit A son of mine , which long I have not seen . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
What is his name ? *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Lucentio , gentle sir . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Happily met ; the happier for thy son . *stop*
And now by law , as well as reverend age , I may entitle thee my loving father : The sister to my wife , this gentlewoman , Thy son by this hath married . *stop*
Wonder not , Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem , Her dowry wealthy , and of worthy birth ; Beside , so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman . *stop*
Let me embrace with old Vincentio ; And wander we to see thy honest son , Who will of thy arrival be full joyous . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
But is this true ; or is it else your pleasure , Like pleasant travellers , to break a jest Upon the company you overtake ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
I do assure thee , father , so it is . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Come , go along , and see the truth hereof ; For our first merriment hath made thee jealous . *stop*
Exeunt all but HORTENSIO HORTENSIO . *stop*
Well , Petruchio , this has put me in heart . *stop*
Have to my widow ; and if she be froward , Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward . *stop*

Before LUCENTIO 'S house Enter BIONDELLO , LUCENTIO , and BIANCA ; GREMIO is out before BIONDELLO . *stop*
Softly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
I fly , Biondello ; but they may chance to need thee at home , therefore leave us . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Nay , faith , I 'll see the church a your back , and then come back to my master 's as soon as I can . *stop*
Exeunt LUCENTIO , BIANCA , and BIONDELLO GREMIO . *stop*
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while . *stop*
Enter PETRUCHIO , KATHERINA , VINCENTIO , GRUMIO , and ATTENDANTS PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Sir , here 's the door ; this is Lucentio 's house ; My father 's bears more toward the market-place ; Thither must I , and here I leave you , sir . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
You shall not choose but drink before you go ; I think I shall command your welcome here , And by all likelihood some cheer is toward . *stop*
[ Knocks ] GREMIO . *stop*
They 're busy within ; you were best knock louder . *stop*
[ PEDANT looks out of the window ] PEDANT . *stop*
What 's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate ? *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Is Signior Lucentio within , sir ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
He 's within , sir , but not to be spoken withal . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself ; he shall need none so long as I live . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Nay , I told you your son was well beloved in Padua . *stop*
Do you hear , sir ? *stop*
To leave frivolous circumstances , I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa , and is here at the door to speak with him . *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Thou liest : his father is come from Padua , and here looking out at the window . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Art thou his father ? *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Ay , sir ; so his mother says , if I may believe her . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
[ To VINCENTIO ] Why , how now , gentleman ! *stop*
Why , this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name . *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Lay hands on the villain ; I believe ' a means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance . *stop*
Re-enter BIONDELLO BIONDELLO . *stop*

VINCENTIO . *stop*
Come hither , you rogue . *stop*
What , have you forgot me ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Forgot you ! *stop*
No , sir . *stop*
I could not forget you , for I never saw you before in all my life . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*

BIONDELLO . *stop*
What , my old worshipful old master ? *stop*
Yes , marry , sir ; see where he looks out of the window . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Is't so , indeed ? *stop*
[ He beats BIONDELLO ] BIONDELLO . *stop*
Help , help , help ! *stop*
Here 's a madman will murder me . *stop*
Exit PEDANT . *stop*
Help , son ! *stop*
help , Signior Baptista ! *stop*
Exit from above PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Prithee , Kate , let 's stand aside and see the end of this controversy . *stop*
[ They stand aside ] Re-enter PEDANT below ; BAPTISTA , TRANIO , and SERVANTS TRANIO . *stop*
Sir , what are you that offer to beat my servant ? *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
What am I , sir ? *stop*
Nay , what are you , sir ? *stop*
O immortal gods ! *stop*
O fine villain ! *stop*
A silken doublet , a velvet hose , a scarlet cloak , and a copatain hat ! *stop*
O , I am undone ! *stop*
I am undone ! *stop*
While I play the good husband at home , my son and my servant spend all at the university . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
How now ! *stop*
what 's the matter ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
What , is the man lunatic ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Sir , you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit , but your words show you a madman . *stop*
Why , sir , what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold ? *stop*
I thank my good father , I am able to maintain it . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Thy father ! *stop*
O villain ! *stop*
he is a sailmaker in Bergamo . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
You mistake , sir ; you mistake , sir . *stop*
Pray , what do you think is his name ? *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
His name ! *stop*
As if I knew not his name ! *stop*
I have brought him up ever since he was three years old , and his name is Tranio . *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Away , away , mad ass ! *stop*
His name is Lucentio ; and he is mine only son , and heir to the lands of me , Signior Vicentio . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Lucentio ! *stop*
O , he hath murd'red his master ! *stop*
Lay hold on him , I charge you , in the Duke 's name . *stop*
O , my son , my son ! *stop*
Tell me , thou villain , where is my son , Lucentio ? *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Call forth an officer . *stop*
Enter one with an OFFICER Carry this mad knave to the gaol . *stop*
Father Baptista , I charge you see that he be forthcoming . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Carry me to the gaol ! *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Stay , Officer ; he shall not go to prison . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Talk not , Signior Gremio ; I say he shall go to prison . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Take heed , Signior Baptista , lest you be cony-catch'd in this business ; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio . *stop*
PEDANT . *stop*
Swear if thou dar'st . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Nay , I dare not swear it . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Yes , I know thee to be Signior Lucentio . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Away with the dotard ; to the gaol with him ! *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Thus strangers may be hal 'd and abus 'd . *stop*
O monstrous villain ! *stop*
Re-enter BIONDELLO , with LUCENTIO and BIANCA BIONDELLO . *stop*
O , we are spoil 'd ; and yonder he is ! *stop*
Deny him , forswear him , or else we are all undone . *stop*
Exeunt BIONDELLO , TRANIO , and PEDANT , as fast as may be LUCENTIO . *stop*
[ Kneeling ] Pardon , sweet father . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Lives my sweet son ? *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Pardon , dear father . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
How hast thou offended ? *stop*
Where is Lucentio ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Here 's Lucentio , Right son to the right Vincentio , That have by marriage made thy daughter mine , While counterfeit supposes blear 'd thine eyne . *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Here 's packing , with a witness , to deceive us all ! *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Where is that damned villain , Tranio , That fac 'd and brav 'd me in this matter so ? *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Why , tell me , is not this my Cambio ? *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Cambio is chang 'd into Lucentio . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Love wrought these miracles . *stop*
Bianca 's love Made me exchange my state with Tranio , While he did bear my countenance in the town ; And happily I have arrived at the last Unto the wished haven of my bliss . *stop*
What Tranio did , myself enforc 'd him to ; Then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
I 'll slit the villain 's nose that would have sent me to the gaol . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
[ To LUCENTIO ] But do you hear , sir ? *stop*
Have you married my daughter without asking my good will ? *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Fear not , Baptista ; we will content you , go to ; but I will in to be revenged for this villainy . *stop*
Exit BAPTISTA . *stop*
And I to sound the depth of this knavery . *stop*
Exit LUCENTIO . *stop*
Look not pale , Bianca ; thy father will not frown . *stop*
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA GREMIO . *stop*
My cake is dough , but I 'll in among the rest ; Out of hope of all but my share of the feast . *stop*
Exit KATHERINA . *stop*
Husband , let 's follow to see the end of this ado . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
First kiss me , Kate , and we will . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
What , in the midst of the street ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
What , art thou asham 'd of me ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
No , sir ; God forbid ; but asham 'd to kiss . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , then , let 's home again . *stop*
Come , sirrah , let's away . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Nay , I will give thee a kiss ; now pray thee , love , stay . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Is not this well ? *stop*
Come , my sweet Kate : Better once than never , for never too late . *stop*
Exeunt SCENE II . *stop*
LUCENTIO 'S house Enter BAPTISTA , VINCENTIO , GREMIO , the PEDANT , LUCENTIO , BIANCA , PETRUCHIO , KATHERINA , HORTENSIO , and WIDOW . *stop*
The SERVINGMEN with TRANIO , BIONDELLO , and GRUMIO , bringing in a banquet LUCENTIO . *stop*
At last , though long , our jarring notes agree ; And time it is when raging war is done To smile at scapes and perils overblown . *stop*
My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , While I with self-same kindness welcome thine . *stop*
Brother Petruchio , sister Katherina , And thou , Hortensio , with thy loving widow , Feast with the best , and welcome to my house . *stop*
My banquet is to close our stomachs up After our great good cheer . *stop*
Pray you , sit down ; For now we sit to chat as well as eat . *stop*
[ They sit ] PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Nothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat ! *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Padua affords this kindness , son Petruchio . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Padua affords nothing but what is kind . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
For both our sakes I would that word were true . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Now , for my life , Hortensio fears his widow . *stop*
WIDOW . *stop*
Then never trust me if I be afeard . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
YOU are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : I mean Hortensio is afeard of you . *stop*
WIDOW . *stop*
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Roundly replied . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Mistress , how mean you that ? *stop*
WIDOW . *stop*
Thus I conceive by him . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Conceives by me ! *stop*
How likes Hortensio that ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
My widow says thus she conceives her tale . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Very well mended . *stop*
Kiss him for that , good widow . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round . ' *stop*
I pray you tell me what you meant by that . *stop*
WIDOW . *stop*
Your husband , being troubled with a shrew , Measures my husband 's sorrow by his woe ; And now you know my meaning . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
A very mean meaning . *stop*
WIDOW . *stop*
Right , I mean you . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
And I am mean , indeed , respecting you . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
To her , Kate ! *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
To her , widow ! *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
A hundred marks , my Kate does put her down . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
That 's my office . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Spoke like an officer- ha ' to thee , lad . *stop*
[ Drinks to HORTENSIO ] BAPTISTA . *stop*
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Believe me , sir , they butt together well . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Head and butt ! *stop*
An hasty-witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
Ay , mistress bride , hath that awakened you ? *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Ay , but not frighted me ; therefore I 'll sleep again . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Nay , that you shall not ; since you have begun , Have at you for a bitter jest or two . *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Am I your bird ? *stop*
I mean to shift my bush , And then pursue me as you draw your bow . *stop*
You are welcome all . *stop*
Exeunt BIANCA , KATHERINA , and WIDOW PETRUCHIO . *stop*
She hath prevented me . *stop*
Here , Signior Tranio , This bird you aim 'd at , though you hit her not ; Therefore a health to all that shot and miss 'd . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
O , sir , Lucentio slipp 'd me like his greyhound , Which runs himself , and catches for his master . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
A good swift simile , but something currish . *stop*
TRANIO . *stop*
'T is well , sir , that you hunted for yourself ; 'T is thought your deer does hold you at a bay . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
O , O , Petruchio ! *stop*
Tranio hits you now . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
I thank thee for that gird , good Tranio . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Confess , confess ; hath he not hit you here ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
' A has a little gall 'd me , I confess ; And , as the jest did glance away from me , 'T is ten to one it maim 'd you two outright . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Now , in good sadness , son Petruchio , I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Well , I say no ; and therefore , for assurance , Let 's each one send unto his wife , And he whose wife is most obedient , To come at first when he doth send for her , Shall win the wager which we will propose . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Content . *stop*
What 's the wager ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Twenty crowns . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Twenty crowns ? *stop*
I 'll venture so much of my hawk or hound , But twenty times so much upon my wife . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
A hundred then . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Content . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
A match ! *stop*
't is done . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Who shall begin ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
That will I . *stop*
Go , Biondello , bid your mistress come to me . *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
I go . *stop*
Exit BAPTISTA . *stop*
Son , I 'll be your half Bianca comes . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
I 'll have no halves ; I 'll bear it all myself . *stop*
Re-enter BIONDELLO How now ! *stop*
what news ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
Sir , my mistress sends you word That she is busy and she can not come . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
How ! *stop*
She 's busy , and she can not come ! *stop*
Is that an answer ? *stop*
GREMIO . *stop*
Ay , and a kind one too . *stop*
Pray God , sir , your wife send you not a worse . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I hope better . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
Sirrah Biondello , go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith . *stop*
Exit BIONDELLO PETRUCHIO . *stop*
O , ho ! *stop*
entreat her ! *stop*
Nay , then she must needs come . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
I am afraid , sir , Do what you can , yours will not be entreated . *stop*
Re-enter BIONDELLO Now , where 's my wife ? *stop*
BIONDELLO . *stop*
She says you have some goodly jest in hand : She will not come ; she bids you come to her . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Worse and worse ; she will not come ! *stop*
O vile , Intolerable , not to be endur 'd ! *stop*
Sirrah Grumio , go to your mistress ; Say I command her come to me . *stop*
Exit GRUMIO HORTENSIO . *stop*
I know her answer . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
What ? *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
She will not . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
The fouler fortune mine , and there an end . *stop*
Re-enter KATHERINA BAPTISTA . *stop*
Now , by my holidame , here comes Katherina ! *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
What is your will , sir , that you send for me ? *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Where is your sister , and Hortensio 's wife ? *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
They sit conferring by the parlour fire . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Go , fetch them hither ; if they deny to come . *stop*
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands . *stop*
Away , I say , and bring them hither straight . *stop*
Exit KATHERINA LUCENTIO . *stop*
Here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder . *stop*
HORTENSIO . *stop*
And so it is . *stop*
I wonder what it bodes . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Marry , peace it bodes , and love , and quiet life , An awful rule , and right supremacy ; And , to be short , what not that 's sweet and happy . *stop*
BAPTISTA . *stop*
Now fair befall thee , good Petruchio ! *stop*
The wager thou hast won ; and I will ad Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns ; Another dowry to another daughter , For she is chang 'd , as she had never been . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Nay , I will win my wager better yet , And show more sign of her obedience , Her new-built virtue and obedience . *stop*
Re-enter KATHERINA with BIANCA and WIDOW See where she comes , and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion . *stop*
Katherine , that cap of yours becomes you not : Off with that bauble , throw it underfoot . *stop*
[ KATHERINA complies ] WIDOW . *stop*
Lord , let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass ! *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
Fie ! *stop*
what a foolish duty call you this ? *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
I would your duty were as foolish too ; The wisdom of your duty , fair Bianca , Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time ! *stop*
BIANCA . *stop*
The more fool you for laying on my duty . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Katherine , I charge thee , tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands . *stop*
WIDOW . *stop*
Come , come , you 're mocking ; we will have no telling . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Come on , I say ; and first begin with her . *stop*
WIDOW . *stop*
She shall not . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
I say she shall . *stop*
And first begin with her . *stop*
KATHERINA . *stop*
Fie , fie ! *stop*
unknit that threatening unkind brow , And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor . *stop*
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads , Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds , And in no sense is meet or amiable . *stop*
A woman mov 'd is like a fountain troubled- Muddy , ill-seeming , thick , bereft of beauty ; And while it is so , none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it . *stop*
Thy husband is thy lord , thy life , thy keeper , Thy head , thy sovereign ; one that cares for thee , And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land , To watch the night in storms , the day in cold , Whilst thou liest warm at home , secure and safe ; And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love , fair looks , and true obedience- Too little payment for so great a debt . *stop*
Such duty as the subject owes the prince , Even such a woman oweth to her husband ; And when she is froward , peevish , sullen , sour , And not obedient to his honest will , What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord ? *stop*
I am asham 'd that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace ; Or seek for rule , supremacy , and sway , When they are bound to serve , love , and obey . *stop*
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , Unapt to toll and trouble in the world , But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts ? *stop*
Come , come , you froward and unable worins ! *stop*
My mind hath been as big as one of yours , My heart as great , my reason haply more , To bandy word for word and frown for frown ; But now I see our lances are but straws , Our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , That seeming to be most which we indeed least are . *stop*
Then vail your stomachs , for it is no boot , And place your hands below your husband 's foot ; In token of which duty , if he please , My hand is ready , may it do him ease . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Why , there 's a wench ! *stop*
Come on , and kiss me , Kate . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
Well , go thy ways , old lad , for thou shalt ha't . *stop*
VINCENTIO . *stop*
'T is a good hearing when children are toward . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
But a harsh hearing when women are froward . *stop*
PETRUCHIO . *stop*
Come , Kate , we 'll to bed . *stop*
We three are married , but you two are sped . *stop*
[ To LUCENTIO ] 'T was I won the wager , though you hit the white ; And being a winner , God give you good night ! *stop*
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA HORTENSIO . *stop*
Now go thy ways ; thou hast tam 'd a curst shrow . *stop*
LUCENTIO . *stop*
'T is a wonder , by your leave , she will be tam 'd so . *stop*
Exeunt THE END *stop*
