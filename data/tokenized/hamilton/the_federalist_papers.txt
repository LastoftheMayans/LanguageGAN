1 General Introduction For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , October 27 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting federal government , you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America . *stop*
The subject speaks its own importance ; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the UNION , the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed , the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world . *stop*
It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country , by their conduct and example , to decide the important question , whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice , or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force . *stop*
If there be any truth in the remark , the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made ; and a wrong election of the part we shall act may , in this view , deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind . *stop*
This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism , to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event . *stop*
Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests , unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good . *stop*
But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected . *stop*
The plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests , innovates upon too many local institutions , not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits , and of views , passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth . *stop*
Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power , emolument , and consequence of the offices they hold under the State establishments ; and the perverted ambition of another class of men , who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country , or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government . *stop*
It is not , however , my design to dwell upon observations of this nature . *stop*
I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men ( merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion ) into interested or ambitious views . *stop*
Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions ; and it can not be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance , or may hereafter make its appearance , will spring from sources , blameless at least , if not respectable -- the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears . *stop*
So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment , that we , upon many occasions , see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society . *stop*
This circumstance , if duly attended to , would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy . *stop*
And a further reason for caution , in this respect , might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists . *stop*
Ambition , avarice , personal animosity , party opposition , and many other motives not more laudable than these , are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question . *stop*
Were there not even these inducements to moderation , nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has , at all times , characterized political parties . *stop*
For in politics , as in religion , it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword . *stop*
Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution . *stop*
And yet , however just these sentiments will be allowed to be , we have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion . *stop*
A torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose . *stop*
To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties , we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions , and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives . *stop*
An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty . *stop*
An over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people , which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart , will be represented as mere pretense and artifice , the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good . *stop*
It will be forgotten , on the one hand , that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love , and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust . *stop*
On the other hand , it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty ; that , in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment , their interest can never be separated ; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government . *stop*
History will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter , and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics , the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people ; commencing demagogues , and ending tyrants . *stop*
In the course of the preceding observations , I have had an eye , my fellow-citizens , to putting you upon your guard against all attempts , from whatever quarter , to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare , by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth . *stop*
You will , no doubt , at the same time , have collected from the general scope of them , that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution . *stop*
Yes , my countrymen , I own to you that , after having given it an attentive consideration , I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it . *stop*
I am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty , your dignity , and your happiness . *stop*
I affect not reserves which I do not feel . *stop*
I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have decided . *stop*
I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions , and I will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded . *stop*
The consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity . *stop*
I shall not , however , multiply professions on this head . *stop*
My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast . *stop*
My arguments will be open to all , and may be judged of by all . *stop*
They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace the cause of truth . *stop*
I propose , in a series of papers , to discuss the following interesting particulars : THE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF A GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED , TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly , THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT , TO LIBERTY , AND TO PROPERTY . *stop*
In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance , that may seem to have any claim to your attention . *stop*
It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the UNION , a point , no doubt , deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State , and one , which it may be imagined , has no adversaries . *stop*
But the fact is , that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new Constitution , that the thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system , and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole . *stop*
This doctrine will , in all probability , be gradually propagated , till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it . *stop*
For nothing can be more evident , to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject , than the alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the Union . *stop*
It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that Union , the certain evils , and the probable dangers , to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution . *stop*
This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address . *stop*

6 Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , November 14 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed , in a state of disunion , from the arms and arts of foreign nations . *stop*
I shall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different and , perhaps , still more alarming kind -- those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between the States themselves , and from domestic factions and convulsions . *stop*
These have been already in some instances slightly anticipated ; but they deserve a more particular and more full investigation . *stop*
A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that , if these States should either be wholly disunited , or only united in partial confederacies , the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other . *stop*
To presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their existence , would be to forget that men are ambitious , vindictive , and rapacious . *stop*
To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of independent , unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood , would be to disregard the uniform course of human events , and to set at defiance the accumulated experience of ages . *stop*
The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable . *stop*
There are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective bodies of society . *stop*
Of this description are the love of power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion -- the jealousy of power , or the desire of equality and safety . *stop*
There are others which have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence within their spheres . *stop*
Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between commercial nations . *stop*
And there are others , not less numerous than either of the former , which take their origin entirely in private passions ; in the attachments , enmities , interests , hopes , and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members . *stop*
Men of this class , whether the favorites of a king or of a people , have in too many instances abused the confidence they possessed ; and assuming the pretext of some public motive , have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification . *stop*
The celebrated Pericles , in compliance with the resentment of a prostitute , at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of his countrymen , attacked , vanquished , and destroyed the city of the SAMMIANS . *stop*
The same man , stimulated by private pique against the MEGARENSIANS , another nation of Greece , or to avoid a prosecution with which he was threatened as an accomplice of a supposed theft of the statuary Phidias , or to get rid of the accusations prepared to be brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in the purchase of popularity , or from a combination of all these causes , was the primitive author of that famous and fatal war , distinguished in the Grecian annals by the name of the PELOPONNESIAN war ; which , after various vicissitudes , intermissions , and renewals , terminated in the ruin of the Athenian commonwealth . *stop*
The ambitious cardinal , who was prime minister to Henry VIII. , permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown , entertained hopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the influence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of this enterprising and powerful monarch , he precipitated England into a war with France , contrary to the plainest dictates of policy , and at the hazard of the safety and independence , as well of the kingdom over which he presided by his counsels , as of Europe in general . *stop*
For if there ever was a sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal monarchy , it was the Emperor Charles V. , of whose intrigues Wolsey was at once the instrument and the dupe . *stop*
The influence which the bigotry of one female , the petulance of another , and the cabals of a third , had in the contemporary policy , ferments , and pacifications , of a considerable part of Europe , are topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally known . *stop*
To multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in the production of great national events , either foreign or domestic , according to their direction , would be an unnecessary waste of time . *stop*
Those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from which they are to be drawn , will themselves recollect a variety of instances ; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the reality or extent of that agency . *stop*
Perhaps , however , a reference , tending to illustrate the general principle , may with propriety be made to a case which has lately happened among ourselves . *stop*
If Shays had not been a DESPERATE DEBTOR , it is much to be doubted whether Massachusetts would have been plunged into a civil war . *stop*
But notwithstanding the concurring testimony of experience , in this particular , there are still to be found visionary or designing men , who stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace between the States , though dismembered and alienated from each other . *stop*
The genius of republics ( say they ) is pacific ; the spirit of commerce has a tendency to soften the manners of men , and to extinguish those inflammable humors which have so often kindled into wars . *stop*
Commercial republics , like ours , will never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions with each other . *stop*
They will be governed by mutual interest , and will cultivate a spirit of mutual amity and concord . *stop*
Is it not ( we may ask these projectors in politics ) the true interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit ? *stop*
If this be their true interest , have they in fact pursued it ? *stop*
Has it not , on the contrary , invariably been found that momentary passions , and immediate interest , have a more active and imperious control over human conduct than general or remote considerations of policy , utility or justice ? *stop*
Have republics in practice been less addicted to war than monarchies ? *stop*
Are not the former administered by MEN as well as the latter ? *stop*
Are there not aversions , predilections , rivalships , and desires of unjust acquisitions , that affect nations as well as kings ? *stop*
Are not popular assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage , resentment , jealousy , avarice , and of other irregular and violent propensities ? *stop*
Is it not well known that their determinations are often governed by a few individuals in whom they place confidence , and are , of course , liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those individuals ? *stop*
Has commerce hitherto done anything more than change the objects of war ? *stop*
Is not the love of wealth as domineering and enterprising a passion as that of power or glory ? *stop*
Have there not been as many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has become the prevailing system of nations , as were before occasioned by the cupidity of territory or dominion ? *stop*
Has not the spirit of commerce , in many instances , administered new incentives to the appetite , both for the one and for the other ? *stop*
Let experience , the least fallible guide of human opinions , be appealed to for an answer to these inquiries . *stop*
Sparta , Athens , Rome , and Carthage were all republics ; two of them , Athens and Carthage , of the commercial kind . *stop*
Yet were they as often engaged in wars , offensive and defensive , as the neighboring monarchies of the same times . *stop*
Sparta was little better than a wellregulated camp ; and Rome was never sated of carnage and conquest . *stop*
Carthage , though a commercial republic , was the aggressor in the very war that ended in her destruction . *stop*
Hannibal had carried her arms into the heart of Italy and to the gates of Rome , before Scipio , in turn , gave him an overthrow in the territories of Carthage , and made a conquest of the commonwealth . *stop*
Venice , in later times , figured more than once in wars of ambition , till , becoming an object to the other Italian states , Pope Julius II . *stop*
found means to accomplish that formidable league , which gave a deadly blow to the power and pride of this haughty republic . *stop*
The provinces of Holland , till they were overwhelmed in debts and taxes , took a leading and conspicuous part in the wars of Europe . *stop*
They had furious contests with England for the dominion of the sea , and were among the most persevering and most implacable of the opponents of Louis XIV . *stop*
In the government of Britain the representatives of the people compose one branch of the national legislature . *stop*
Commerce has been for ages the predominant pursuit of that country . *stop*
Few nations , nevertheless , have been more frequently engaged in war ; and the wars in which that kingdom has been engaged have , in numerous instances , proceeded from the people . *stop*
There have been , if I may so express it , almost as many popular as royal wars . *stop*
The cries of the nation and the importunities of their representatives have , upon various occasions , dragged their monarchs into war , or continued them in it , contrary to their inclinations , and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the State . *stop*
In that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of AUSTRIA and BOURBON , which so long kept Europe in a flame , it is well known that the antipathies of the English against the French , seconding the ambition , or rather the avarice , of a favorite leader , protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by sound policy , and for a considerable time in opposition to the views of the court . *stop*
The wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great measure grown out of commercial considerations , -- the desire of supplanting and the fear of being supplanted , either in particular branches of traffic or in the general advantages of trade and navigation , and sometimes even the more culpable desire of sharing in the commerce of other nations without their consent . *stop*
The last war but between Britain and Spain sprang from the attempts of the British merchants to prosecute an illicit trade with the Spanish main . *stop*
These unjustifiable practices on their part produced severity on the part of the Spaniards toward the subjects of Great Britain which were not more justifiable , because they exceeded the bounds of a just retaliation and were chargeable with inhumanity and cruelty . *stop*
Many of the English who were taken on the Spanish coast were sent to dig in the mines of Potosi ; and by the usual progress of a spirit of resentment , the innocent were , after a while , confounded with the guilty in indiscriminate punishment . *stop*
The complaints of the merchants kindled a violent flame throughout the nation , which soon after broke out in the House of Commons , and was communicated from that body to the ministry . *stop*
Letters of reprisal were granted , and a war ensued , which in its consequences overthrew all the alliances that but twenty years before had been formed with sanguine expectations of the most beneficial fruits . *stop*
From this summary of what has taken place in other countries , whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own , what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present confederacy , in a state of separation ? *stop*
Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections , weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape ? *stop*
Is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age , and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we , as well as the other inhabitants of the globe , are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue ? *stop*
Let the point of extreme depression to which our national dignity and credit have sunk , let the inconveniences felt everywhere from a lax and ill administration of government , let the revolt of a part of the State of North Carolina , the late menacing disturbances in Pennsylvania , and the actual insurrections and rebellions in Massachusetts , declare -- ! *stop*
So far is the general sense of mankind from corresponding with the tenets of those who endeavor to lull asleep our apprehensions of discord and hostility between the States , in the event of disunion , that it has from long observation of the progress of society become a sort of axiom in politics , that vicinity or nearness of situation , constitutes nations natural enemies . *stop*
An intelligent writer expresses himself on this subject to this effect : `` NEIGHBORING NATIONS ( says he ) are naturally enemies of each other unless their common weakness forces them to league in a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC , and their constitution prevents the differences that neighborhood occasions , extinguishing that secret jealousy which disposes all states to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their neighbors . '' *stop*
This passage , at the same time , points out the EVIL and suggests the REMEDY . *stop*

7 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States ) For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Thursday , November 15 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IT IS sometimes asked , with an air of seeming triumph , what inducements could the States have , if disunited , to make war upon each other ? *stop*
It would be a full answer to this question to say -- precisely the same inducements which have , at different times , deluged in blood all the nations in the world . *stop*
But , unfortunately for us , the question admits of a more particular answer . *stop*
There are causes of differences within our immediate contemplation , of the tendency of which , even under the restraints of a federal constitution , we have had sufficient experience to enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected if those restraints were removed . *stop*
Territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most fertile sources of hostility among nations . *stop*
Perhaps the greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have sprung from this origin . *stop*
This cause would exist among us in full force . *stop*
We have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the United States . *stop*
There still are discordant and undecided claims between several of them , and the dissolution of the Union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them all . *stop*
It is well known that they have heretofore had serious and animated discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were ungranted at the time of the Revolution , and which usually went under the name of crown lands . *stop*
The States within the limits of whose colonial governments they were comprised have claimed them as their property , the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this article devolved upon the Union ; especially as to all that part of the Western territory which , either by actual possession , or through the submission of the Indian proprietors , was subjected to the jurisdiction of the king of Great Britain , till it was relinquished in the treaty of peace . *stop*
This , it has been said , was at all events an acquisition to the Confederacy by compact with a foreign power . *stop*
It has been the prudent policy of Congress to appease this controversy , by prevailing upon the States to make cessions to the United States for the benefit of the whole . *stop*
This has been so far accomplished as , under a continuation of the Union , to afford a decided prospect of an amicable termination of the dispute . *stop*
A dismemberment of the Confederacy , however , would revive this dispute , and would create others on the same subject . *stop*
At present , a large part of the vacant Western territory is , by cession at least , if not by any anterior right , the common property of the Union . *stop*
If that were at an end , the States which made the cession , on a principle of federal compromise , would be apt when the motive of the grant had ceased , to reclaim the lands as a reversion . *stop*
The other States would no doubt insist on a proportion , by right of representation . *stop*
Their argument would be , that a grant , once made , could not be revoked ; and that the justice of participating in territory acquired or secured by the joint efforts of the Confederacy , remained undiminished . *stop*
If , contrary to probability , it should be admitted by all the States , that each had a right to a share of this common stock , there would still be a difficulty to be surmounted , as to a proper rule of apportionment . *stop*
Different principles would be set up by different States for this purpose ; and as they would affect the opposite interests of the parties , they might not easily be susceptible of a pacific adjustment . *stop*
In the wide field of Western territory , therefore , we perceive an ample theatre for hostile pretensions , without any umpire or common judge to interpose between the contending parties . *stop*
To reason from the past to the future , we shall have good ground to apprehend , that the sword would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences . *stop*
The circumstances of the dispute between Connecticut and Pennsylvania , respecting the land at Wyoming , admonish us not to be sanguine in expecting an easy accommodation of such differences . *stop*
The articles of confederation obliged the parties to submit the matter to the decision of a federal court . *stop*
The submission was made , and the court decided in favor of Pennsylvania . *stop*
But Connecticut gave strong indications of dissatisfaction with that determination ; nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to it , till , by negotiation and management , something like an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have sustained . *stop*
Nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest censure on the conduct of that State . *stop*
She no doubt sincerely believed herself to have been injured by the decision ; and States , like individuals , acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations to their disadvantage . *stop*
Those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the transactions which attended the progress of the controversy between this State and the district of Vermont , can vouch the opposition we experienced , as well from States not interested as from those which were interested in the claim ; and can attest the danger to which the peace of the Confederacy might have been exposed , had this State attempted to assert its rights by force . *stop*
Two motives preponderated in that opposition : one , a jealousy entertained of our future power ; and the other , the interest of certain individuals of influence in the neighboring States , who had obtained grants of lands under the actual government of that district . *stop*
Even the States which brought forward claims , in contradiction to ours , seemed more solicitous to dismember this State , than to establish their own pretensions . *stop*
These were New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and Connecticut . *stop*
New Jersey and Rhode Island , upon all occasions , discovered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont ; and Maryland , till alarmed by the appearance of a connection between Canada and that State , entered deeply into the same views . *stop*
These being small States , saw with an unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness . *stop*
In a review of these transactions we may trace some of the causes which would be likely to embroil the States with each other , if it should be their unpropitious destiny to become disunited . *stop*
The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of contention . *stop*
The States less favorably circumstanced would be desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation , and of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors . *stop*
Each State , or separate confederacy , would pursue a system of commercial policy peculiar to itself . *stop*
This would occasion distinctions , preferences , and exclusions , which would beget discontent . *stop*
The habits of intercourse , on the basis of equal privileges , to which we have been accustomed since the earliest settlement of the country , would give a keener edge to those causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this circumstance . *stop*
WE SHOULD BE READY TO DENOMINATE INJURIES THOSE THINGS WHICH WERE IN REALITY THE JUSTIFIABLE ACTS OF INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGNTIES CONSULTING A DISTINCT INTEREST . *stop*
The spirit of enterprise , which characterizes the commercial part of America , has left no occasion of displaying itself unimproved . *stop*
It is not at all probable that this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations of trade by which particular States might endeavor to secure exclusive benefits to their own citizens . *stop*
The infractions of these regulations , on one side , the efforts to prevent and repel them , on the other , would naturally lead to outrages , and these to reprisals and wars . *stop*
The opportunities which some States would have of rendering others tributary to them by commercial regulations would be impatiently submitted to by the tributary States . *stop*
The relative situation of New York , Connecticut , and New Jersey would afford an example of this kind . *stop*
New York , from the necessities of revenue , must lay duties on her importations . *stop*
A great part of these duties must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other States in the capacity of consumers of what we import . *stop*
New York would neither be willing nor able to forego this advantage . *stop*
Her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors ; nor would it be practicable , if there were not this impediment in the way , to distinguish the customers in our own markets . *stop*
Would Connecticut and New Jersey long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit ? *stop*
Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a metropolis , from the possession of which we derived an advantage so odious to our neighbors , and , in their opinion , so oppressive ? *stop*
Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of Connecticut on the one side , and the co-operating pressure of New Jersey on the other ? *stop*
These are questions that temerity alone will answer in the affirmative . *stop*
The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision between the separate States or confederacies . *stop*
The apportionment , in the first instance , and the progressive extinguishment afterward , would be alike productive of ill-humor and animosity . *stop*
How would it be possible to agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all ? *stop*
There is scarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real objections . *stop*
These , as usual , would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties . *stop*
There are even dissimilar views among the States as to the general principle of discharging the public debt . *stop*
Some of them , either less impressed with the importance of national credit , or because their citizens have little , if any , immediate interest in the question , feel an indifference , if not a repugnance , to the payment of the domestic debt at any rate . *stop*
These would be inclined to magnify the difficulties of a distribution . *stop*
Others of them , a numerous body of whose citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the State in the total amount of the national debt , would be strenuous for some equitable and effective provision . *stop*
The procrastinations of the former would excite the resentments of the latter . *stop*
The settlement of a rule would , in the meantime , be postponed by real differences of opinion and affected delays . *stop*
The citizens of the States interested would clamour ; foreign powers would urge for the satisfaction of their just demands , and the peace of the States would be hazarded to the double contingency of external invasion and internal contention . *stop*
Suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted , and the apportionment made . *stop*
Still there is great room to suppose that the rule agreed upon would , upon experiment , be found to bear harder upon some States than upon others . *stop*
Those which were sufferers by it would naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden . *stop*
The others would as naturally be disinclined to a revision , which was likely to end in an increase of their own incumbrances . *stop*
Their refusal would be too plausible a pretext to the complaining States to withhold their contributions , not to be embraced with avidity ; and the non-compliance of these States with their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and altercation . *stop*
If even the rule adopted should in practice justify the equality of its principle , still delinquencies in payments on the part of some of the States would result from a diversity of other causes -- the real deficiency of resources ; the mismanagement of their finances ; accidental disorders in the management of the government ; and , in addition to the rest , the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced them , and interfere with the supply of immediate wants . *stop*
Delinquencies , from whatever causes , would be productive of complaints , recriminations , and quarrels . *stop*
There is , perhaps , nothing more likely to disturb the tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident benefit . *stop*
For it is an observation , as true as it is trite , that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the payment of money . *stop*
Laws in violation of private contracts , as they amount to aggressions on the rights of those States whose citizens are injured by them , may be considered as another probable source of hostility . *stop*
We are not authorized to expect that a more liberal or more equitable spirit would preside over the legislations of the individual States hereafter , if unrestrained by any additional checks , than we have heretofore seen in too many instances disgracing their several codes . *stop*
We have observed the disposition to retaliation excited in Connecticut in consequence of the enormities perpetrated by the Legislature of Rhode Island ; and we reasonably infer that , in similar cases , under other circumstances , a war , not of PARCHMENT , but of the sword , would chastise such atrocious breaches of moral obligation and social justice . *stop*
The probability of incompatible alliances between the different States or confederacies and different foreign nations , and the effects of this situation upon the peace of the whole , have been sufficiently unfolded in some preceding papers . *stop*
From the view they have exhibited of this part of the subject , this conclusion is to be drawn , that America , if not connected at all , or only by the feeble tie of a simple league , offensive and defensive , would , by the operation of such jarring alliances , be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of European politics and wars ; and by the destructive contentions of the parts into which she was divided , would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them all . *stop*
Divide et impera must be the motto of every nation that either hates or fears us . *stop*

HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : ASSUMING it therefore as an established truth that the several States , in case of disunion , or such combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general Confederacy , would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war , of friendship and enmity , with each other , which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not united under one government , let us enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would attend such a situation . *stop*
War between the States , in the first period of their separate existence , would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments have long obtained . *stop*
The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe , though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and economy , have , notwithstanding , been productive of the signal advantage of rendering sudden conquests impracticable , and of preventing that rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their introduction . *stop*
The art of fortification has contributed to the same ends . *stop*
The nations of Europe are encircled with chains of fortified places , which mutually obstruct invasion . *stop*
Campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons , to gain admittance into an enemy 's country . *stop*
Similar impediments occur at every step , to exhaust the strength and delay the progress of an invader . *stop*
Formerly , an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received ; but now a comparatively small force of disciplined troops , acting on the defensive , with the aid of posts , is able to impede , and finally to frustrate , the enterprises of one much more considerable . *stop*
The history of war , in that quarter of the globe , is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned , but of towns taken and retaken ; of battles that decide nothing ; of retreats more beneficial than victories ; of much effort and little acquisition . *stop*
In this country the scene would be altogether reversed . *stop*
The jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as possible . *stop*
The want of fortifications , leaving the frontiers of one state open to another , would facilitate inroads . *stop*
The populous States would , with little difficulty , overrun their less populous neighbors . *stop*
Conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained . *stop*
War , therefore , would be desultory and predatory . *stop*
PLUNDER and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars . *stop*
The calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events which would characterize our military exploits . *stop*
This picture is not too highly wrought ; though , I confess , it would not long remain a just one . *stop*
Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct . *stop*
Even the ardent love of liberty will , after a time , give way to its dictates . *stop*
The violent destruction of life and property incident to war , the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger , will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights . *stop*
To be more safe , they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free . *stop*
The institutions chiefly alluded to are STANDING ARMIES and the correspondent appendages of military establishments . *stop*
Standing armies , it is said , are not provided against in the new Constitution ; and it is therefore inferred that they may exist under it . *stop*
Their existence , however , from the very terms of the proposition , is , at most , problematical and uncertain . *stop*
But standing armies , it may be replied , must inevitably result from a dissolution of the Confederacy . *stop*
Frequent war and constant apprehension , which require a state of as constant preparation , will infallibly produce them . *stop*
The weaker States or confederacies would first have recourse to them , to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent neighbors . *stop*
They would endeavor to supply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular and effective system of defense , by disciplined troops , and by fortifications . *stop*
They would , at the same time , be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government , in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy . *stop*
It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority . *stop*
The expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the States or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors . *stop*
Small states , or states of less natural strength , under vigorous governments , and with the assistance of disciplined armies , have often triumphed over large states , or states of greater natural strength , which have been destitute of these advantages . *stop*
Neither the pride nor the safety of the more important States or confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority . *stop*
They would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected , to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence . *stop*
Thus , we should , in a little time , see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old World . *stop*
This , at least , would be the natural course of things ; and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just , in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard . *stop*
These are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative defects in a Constitution , the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of a people , or their representatives and delegates , but they are solid conclusions , drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs . *stop*
It may , perhaps , be asked , by way of objection to this , why did not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often distracted the ancient republics of Greece ? *stop*
Different answers , equally satisfactory , may be given to this question . *stop*
The industrious habits of the people of the present day , absorbed in the pursuits of gain , and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce , are incompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers , which was the true condition of the people of those republics . *stop*
The means of revenue , which have been so greatly multiplied by the increase of gold and silver and of the arts of industry , and the science of finance , which is the offspring of modern times , concurring with the habits of nations , have produced an entire revolution in the system of war , and have rendered disciplined armies , distinct from the body of the citizens , the inseparable companions of frequent hostility . *stop*
There is a wide difference , also , between military establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions , and in one which is often subject to them , and always apprehensive of them . *stop*
The rulers of the former can have no good pretext , if they are even so inclined , to keep on foot armies so numerous as must of necessity be maintained in the latter . *stop*
These armies being , in the first case , rarely , if at all , called into activity for interior defense , the people are in no danger of being broken to military subordination . *stop*
The laws are not accustomed to relaxations , in favor of military exigencies ; the civil state remains in full vigor , neither corrupted , nor confounded with the principles or propensities of the other state . *stop*
The smallness of the army renders the natural strength of the community an overmatch for it ; and the citizens , not habituated to look up to the military power for protection , or to submit to its oppressions , neither love nor fear the soldiery ; they view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a necessary evil , and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights . *stop*
The army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate to suppress a small faction , or an occasional mob , or insurrection ; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united efforts of the great body of the people . *stop*
In a country in the predicament last described , the contrary of all this happens . *stop*
The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be always prepared to repel it ; its armies must be numerous enough for instant defense . *stop*
The continual necessity for their services enhances the importance of the soldier , and proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen . *stop*
The military state becomes elevated above the civil . *stop*
The inhabitants of territories , often the theatre of war , are unavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights , which serve to weaken their sense of those rights ; and by degrees the people are brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors , but as their superiors . *stop*
The transition from this disposition to that of considering them masters , is neither remote nor difficult ; but it is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions , to make a bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by the military power . *stop*
The kingdom of Great Britain falls within the first description . *stop*
An insular situation , and a powerful marine , guarding it in a great measure against the possibility of foreign invasion , supersede the necessity of a numerous army within the kingdom . *stop*
A sufficient force to make head against a sudden descent , till the militia could have time to rally and embody , is all that has been deemed requisite . *stop*
No motive of national policy has demanded , nor would public opinion have tolerated , a larger number of troops upon its domestic establishment . *stop*
There has been , for a long time past , little room for the operation of the other causes , which have been enumerated as the consequences of internal war . *stop*
This peculiar felicity of situation has , in a great degree , contributed to preserve the liberty which that country to this day enjoys , in spite of the prevalent venality and corruption . *stop*
If , on the contrary , Britain had been situated on the continent , and had been compelled , as she would have been , by that situation , to make her military establishments at home coextensive with those of the other great powers of Europe , she , like them , would in all probability be , at this day , a victim to the absolute power of a single man . *stop*
It is possible , though not easy , that the people of that island may be enslaved from other causes ; but it can not be by the prowess of an army so inconsiderable as that which has been usually kept up within the kingdom . *stop*
If we are wise enough to preserve the Union we may for ages enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation . *stop*
Europe is at a great distance from us . *stop*
Her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance . *stop*
Extensive military establishments can not , in this position , be necessary to our security . *stop*
But if we should be disunited , and the integral parts should either remain separated , or , which is most probable , should be thrown together into two or three confederacies , we should be , in a short course of time , in the predicament of the continental powers of Europe -- our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other . *stop*
This is an idea not superficial or futile , but solid and weighty . *stop*
It deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every prudent and honest man of whatever party . *stop*
If such men will make a firm and solemn pause , and meditate dispassionately on the importance of this interesting idea ; if they will contemplate it in all its attitudes , and trace it to all its consequences , they will not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a Constitution , the rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to the Union . *stop*
The airy phantoms that flit before the distempered imaginations of some of its adversaries would quickly give place to the more substantial forms of dangers , real , certain , and formidable . *stop*

9 The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , November 21 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : A FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States , as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection . *stop*
It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated , and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy . *stop*
If they exhibit occasional calms , these only serve as short-lived contrast to the furious storms that are to succeed . *stop*
If now and then intervals of felicity open to view , we behold them with a mixture of regret , arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage . *stop*
If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom , while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy , they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated . *stop*
From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments , not only against the forms of republican government , but against the very principles of civil liberty . *stop*
They have decried all free government as inconsistent with the order of society , and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends and partisans . *stop*
Happily for mankind , stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty , which have flourished for ages , have , in a few glorious instances , refuted their gloomy sophisms . *stop*
And , I trust , America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices , not less magnificent , which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors . *stop*
But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of republican government were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken . *stop*
If it had been found impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure , the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible . *stop*
The science of politics , however , like most other sciences , has received great improvement . *stop*
The efficacy of various principles is now well understood , which were either not known at all , or imperfectly known to the ancients . *stop*
The regular distribution of power into distinct departments ; the introduction of legislative balances and checks ; the institution of courts composed of judges holding their offices during good behavior ; the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election : these are wholly new discoveries , or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern times . *stop*
They are means , and powerful means , by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided . *stop*
To this catalogue of circumstances that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government , I shall venture , however novel it may appear to some , to add one more , on a principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the new Constitution ; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such systems are to revolve , either in respect to the dimensions of a single State or to the consolidation of several smaller States into one great Confederacy . *stop*
The latter is that which immediately concerns the object under consideration . *stop*
It will , however , be of use to examine the principle in its application to a single State , which shall be attended to in another place . *stop*
The utility of a Confederacy , as well to suppress faction and to guard the internal tranquillity of States , as to increase their external force and security , is in reality not a new idea . *stop*
It has been practiced upon in different countries and ages , and has received the sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of politics . *stop*
The opponents of the plan proposed have , with great assiduity , cited and circulated the observations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government . *stop*
But they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work , nor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they subscribe with such ready acquiescence . *stop*
When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics , the standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these States . *stop*
Neither Virginia , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , New York , North Carolina , nor Georgia can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply . *stop*
If we therefore take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth , we shall be driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy , or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of little , jealous , clashing , tumultuous commonwealths , the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord , and the miserable objects of universal pity or contempt . *stop*
Some of the writers who have come forward on the other side of the question seem to have been aware of the dilemma ; and have even been bold enough to hint at the division of the larger States as a desirable thing . *stop*
Such an infatuated policy , such a desperate expedient , might , by the multiplication of petty offices , answer the views of men who possess not qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue , but it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of America . *stop*
Referring the examination of the principle itself to another place , as has been already mentioned , it will be sufficient to remark here that , in the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted upon the occasion , it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of the more considerable MEMBERS of the Union , but would not militate against their being all comprehended in one confederate government . *stop*
And this is the true question , in the discussion of which we are at present interested . *stop*
So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition to a general Union of the States , that he explicitly treats of a confederate republic as the expedient for extending the sphere of popular government , and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with those of republicanism . *stop*
`` It is very probable , '' ( says he `` that mankind would have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single person , had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican , together with the external force of a monarchical government . *stop*
I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC . '' *stop*
`` This form of government is a convention by which several smaller STATES agree to become members of a larger ONE , which they intend to form . *stop*
It is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one , capable of increasing , by means of new associations , till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united body . '' *stop*
`` A republic of this kind , able to withstand an external force , may support itself without any internal corruptions . *stop*
The form of this society prevents all manner of inconveniences . '' *stop*
`` If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority , he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states . *stop*
Were he to have too great influence over one , this would alarm the rest . *stop*
Were he to subdue a part , that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation . '' *stop*
`` Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states the others are able to quell it . *stop*
Should abuses creep into one part , they are reformed by those that remain sound . *stop*
The state may be destroyed on one side , and not on the other ; the confederacy may be dissolved , and the confederates preserve their sovereignty . '' *stop*
`` As this government is composed of small republics , it enjoys the internal happiness of each ; and with respect to its external situation , it is possessed , by means of the association , of all the advantages of large monarchies . '' *stop*
I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages , because they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments in favor of the Union , and must effectually remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to make . *stop*
They have , at the same time , an intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper ; which is , to illustrate the tendency of the Union to repress domestic faction and insurrection . *stop*
A distinction , more subtle than accurate , has been raised between a CONFEDERACY and a CONSOLIDATION of the States . *stop*
The essential characteristic of the first is said to be , the restriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities , without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed . *stop*
It is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration . *stop*
An exact equality of suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government . *stop*
These positions are , in the main , arbitrary ; they are supported neither by principle nor precedent . *stop*
It has indeed happened , that governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken notice of , supposes to be inherent in their nature ; but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice , which serve to prove , as far as example will go , that there is no absolute rule on the subject . *stop*
And it will be clearly shown in the course of this investigation that as far as the principle contended for has prevailed , it has been the cause of incurable disorder and imbecility in the government . *stop*
The definition of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC seems simply to be `` an assemblage of societies , '' or an association of two or more states into one state . *stop*
The extent , modifications , and objects of the federal authority are mere matters of discretion . *stop*
So long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished ; so long as it exists , by a constitutional necessity , for local purposes ; though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union , it would still be , in fact and in theory , an association of states , or a confederacy . *stop*
The proposed Constitution , so far from implying an abolition of the State governments , makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty , by allowing them a direct representation in the Senate , and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power . *stop*
This fully corresponds , in every rational import of the terms , with the idea of a federal government . *stop*
In the Lycian confederacy , which consisted of twenty-three CITIES or republics , the largest were entitled to THREE votes in the COMMON COUNCIL , those of the middle class to TWO , and the smallest to ONE . *stop*
The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of the respective CITIES . *stop*
This was certainly the most , delicate species of interference in their internal administration ; for if there be any thing that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions , it is the appointment of their own officers . *stop*
Yet Montesquieu , speaking of this association , says : `` Were I to give a model of an excellent Confederate Republic , it would be that of Lycia . '' *stop*
Thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian ; and we shall be led to conclude , that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
11 The Utility of the Union in Respect to Commercial Relations and a Navy For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , November 24 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE importance of the Union , in a commercial light , is one of those points about which there is least room to entertain a difference of opinion , and which has , in fact , commanded the most general assent of men who have any acquaintance with the subject . *stop*
This applies as well to our intercourse with foreign countries as with each other . *stop*
There are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous spirit , which distinguishes the commercial character of America , has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of Europe . *stop*
They seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in that carrying trade , which is the support of their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength . *stop*
Those of them which have colonies in America look forward to what this country is capable of becoming , with painful solicitude . *stop*
They foresee the dangers that may threaten their American dominions from the neighborhood of States , which have all the dispositions , and would possess all the means , requisite to the creation of a powerful marine . *stop*
Impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fostering divisions among us , and of depriving us , as far as possible , of an ACTIVE COMMERCE in our own bottoms . *stop*
This would answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their navigation , of monopolizing the profits of our trade , and of clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness . *stop*
Did not prudence forbid the detail , it would not be difficult to trace , by facts , the workings of this policy to the cabinets of ministers . *stop*
If we continue united , we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways . *stop*
By prohibitory regulations , extending , at the same time , throughout the States , we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each other , for the privileges of our markets . *stop*
This assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of people -- increasing in rapid progression , for the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture , and likely from local circumstances to remain so -- to any manufacturing nation ; and the immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of such a nation , between a direct communication in its own ships , and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns , to and from America , in the ships of another country . *stop*
Suppose , for instance , we had a government in America , capable of excluding Great Britain ( with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce ) from all our ports ; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics ? *stop*
Would it not enable us to negotiate , with the fairest prospect of success , for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind , in the dominions of that kingdom ? *stop*
When these questions have been asked , upon other occasions , they have received a plausible , but not a solid or satisfactory answer . *stop*
It has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the system of Britain , because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium of the Dutch , who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of our markets . *stop*
But would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade ? *stop*
Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch , as a compensation for their agency and risk ? *stop*
Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction ? *stop*
Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations , by enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets , and by transferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the British commerce ? *stop*
A mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to Britain from such a state of things , conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the American trade , and with the importunities of the West India islands , would produce a relaxation in her present system , and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands elsewhere , from which our trade would derive the most substantial benefits . *stop*
Such a point gained from the British government , and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets , would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations , who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade . *stop*
A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us , in this respect , would arise from the establishment of a federal navy . *stop*
There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power , at a period not very distant , to create a navy which , if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers , would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties . *stop*
This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies . *stop*
A few ships of the line , sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side , would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign , on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended . *stop*
Our position is , in this respect , a most commanding one . *stop*
And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country , in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies , it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges . *stop*
A price would be set not only upon our friendship , but upon our neutrality . *stop*
By a steady adherence to the Union we may hope , erelong , to become the arbiter of Europe in America , and to be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate . *stop*
But in the reverse of this eligible situation , we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other , and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach . *stop*
In a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other ; who , having nothing to fear from us , would with little scruple or remorse , supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way . *stop*
The rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power . *stop*
A nation , despicable by its weakness , forfeits even the privilege of being neutral . *stop*
Under a vigorous national government , the natural strength and resources of the country , directed to a common interest , would baffle all the combinations of European jealousy to restrain our growth . *stop*
This situation would even take away the motive to such combinations , by inducing an impracticability of success . *stop*
An active commerce , an extensive navigation , and a flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity . *stop*
We might defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature . *stop*
But in a state of disunion , these combinations might exist and might operate with success . *stop*
It would be in the power of the maritime nations , availing themselves of our universal impotence , to prescribe the conditions of our political existence ; and as they have a common interest in being our carriers , and still more in preventing our becoming theirs , they would in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it , and confine us to a PASSIVE COMMERCE . *stop*
We should then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our commodities , and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and persecutors . *stop*
That unequaled spirit of enterprise , which signalizes the genius of the American merchants and navigators , and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth , would be stifled and lost , and poverty and disgrace would overspread a country which , with wisdom , might make herself the admiration and envy of the world . *stop*
There are rights of great moment to the trade of America which are rights of the Union -- I allude to the fisheries , to the navigation of the Western lakes , and to that of the Mississippi . *stop*
The dissolution of the Confederacy would give room for delicate questions concerning the future existence of these rights ; which the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage . *stop*
The disposition of Spain with regard to the Mississippi needs no comment . *stop*
France and Britain are concerned with us in the fisheries , and view them as of the utmost moment to their navigation . *stop*
They , of course , would hardly remain long indifferent to that decided mastery , of which experience has shown us to be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic , and by which we are able to undersell those nations in their own markets . *stop*
What more natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists such dangerous competitors ? *stop*
This branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit . *stop*
All the navigating States may , in different degrees , advantageously participate in it , and under circumstances of a greater extension of mercantile capital , would not be unlikely to do it . *stop*
As a nursery of seamen , it now is , or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the principles of navigation in the several States , will become , a universal resource . *stop*
To the establishment of a navy , it must be indispensable . *stop*
To this great national object , a NAVY , union will contribute in various ways . *stop*
Every institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentred towards its formation and support . *stop*
A navy of the United States , as it would embrace the resources of all , is an object far less remote than a navy of any single State or partial confederacy , which would only embrace the resources of a single part . *stop*
It happens , indeed , that different portions of confederated America possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential establishment . *stop*
The more southern States furnish in greater abundance certain kinds of naval stores -- tar , pitch , and turpentine . *stop*
Their wood for the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture . *stop*
The difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be composed , if chiefly constructed of Southern wood , would be of signal importance , either in the view of naval strength or of national economy . *stop*
Some of the Southern and of the Middle States yield a greater plenty of iron , and of better quality . *stop*
Seamen must chiefly be drawn from the Northern hive . *stop*
The necessity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation , no more than the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy . *stop*
An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions , not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home , but for exportation to foreign markets . *stop*
The veins of commerce in every part will be replenished , and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part . *stop*
Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope , from the diversity in the productions of different States . *stop*
When the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop , it can call to its aid the staple of another . *stop*
The variety , not less than the value , of products for exportation contributes to the activity of foreign commerce . *stop*
It can be conducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value than with a small number of materials of the same value ; arising from the competitions of trade and from the fluctuations of markets . *stop*
Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods , and unsalable at others ; but if there be a variety of articles , it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter predicament , and on this account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation . *stop*
The speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these observations , and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions . *stop*
It may perhaps be replied to this , that whether the States are united or disunited , there would still be an intimate intercourse between them which would answer the same ends ; this intercourse would be fettered , interrupted , and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes , which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed . *stop*
A unity of commercial , as well as political , interests , can only result from a unity of government . *stop*
There are other points of view in which this subject might be placed , of a striking and animating kind . *stop*
But they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity , and would involve topics not proper for a newspaper discussion . *stop*
I shall briefly observe , that our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of American affairs . *stop*
The world may politically , as well as geographically , be divided into four parts , each having a distinct set of interests . *stop*
Unhappily for the other three , Europe , by her arms and by her negotiations , by force and by fraud , has , in different degrees , extended her dominion over them all . *stop*
Africa , Asia , and America , have successively felt her domination . *stop*
The superiority she has long maintained has tempted her to plume herself as the Mistress of the World , and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit . *stop*
Men admired as profound philosophers have , in direct terms , attributed to her inhabitants a physical superiority , and have gravely asserted that all animals , and with them the human species , degenerate in America -- that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere . *stop*
Facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the Europeans . *stop*
It belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race , and to teach that assuming brother , moderation . *stop*
Union will enable us to do it . *stop*
Disunion will will add another victim to his triumphs . *stop*
Let Americans disdain to be the instruments of European greatness ! *stop*
Let the thirteen States , bound together in a strict and indissoluble Union , concur in erecting one great American system , superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence , and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world ! *stop*

12 The Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , November 27 , 1787 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE effects of Union upon the commercial prosperity of the States have been sufficiently delineated . *stop*
Its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry . *stop*
The prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth , and has accordingly become a primary object of their political cares . *stop*
By multiplying the means of gratification , by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals , those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise , it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry , and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness . *stop*
The assiduous merchant , the laborious husbandman , the active mechanic , and the industrious manufacturer , -- all orders of men , look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils . *stop*
The often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce has , from indubitable experience , received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once subsisted between them , and has proved , to the satisfaction of their friends , that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven . *stop*
It has been found in various countries that , in proportion as commerce has flourished , land has risen in value . *stop*
And how could it have happened otherwise ? *stop*
Could that which procures a freer vent for the products of the earth , which furnishes new incitements to the cultivation of land , which is the most powerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money in a state -- could that , in fine , which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry , in every shape , fail to augment that article , which is the prolific parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted ? *stop*
It is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an adversary ; and it is one , among a multitude of proofs , how apt a spirit of ill-informed jealousy , or of too great abstraction and refinement , is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason and conviction . *stop*
The ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned , in a great degree , to the quantity of money in circulation , and to the celerity with which it circulates . *stop*
Commerce , contributing to both these objects , must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier , and facilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury . *stop*
The hereditary dominions of the Emperor of Germany contain a great extent of fertile , cultivated , and populous territory , a large proportion of which is situated in mild and luxuriant climates . *stop*
In some parts of this territory are to be found the best gold and silver mines in Europe . *stop*
And yet , from the want of the fostering influence of commerce , that monarch can boast but slender revenues . *stop*
He has several times been compelled to owe obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the preservation of his essential interests , and is unable , upon the strength of his own resources , to sustain a long or continued war . *stop*
But it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that Union will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue . *stop*
There are other points of view , in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive . *stop*
It is evident from the state of the country , from the habits of the people , from the experience we have had on the point itself , that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation . *stop*
Tax laws have in vain been multiplied ; new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried ; the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed , and the treasuries of the States have remained empty . *stop*
The popular system of administration inherent in the nature of popular government , coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade , has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections , and has at length taught the different legislatures the folly of attempting them . *stop*
No person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be surprised at this circumstance . *stop*
In so opulent a nation as that of Britain , where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more tolerable , and , from the vigor of the government , much more practicable , than in America , far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind , from imposts , and from excises . *stop*
Duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description . *stop*
In America , it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties . *stop*
In most parts of it , excises must be confined within a narrow compass . *stop*
The genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws . *stop*
The pockets of the farmers , on the other hand , will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies , in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and lands ; and personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the imperceptible agency of taxes on consumption . *stop*
If these remarks have any foundation , that state of things which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be best adapted to our political welfare . *stop*
And it can not admit of a serious doubt , that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general Union . *stop*
As far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce , so far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from that source . *stop*
As far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more simple and efficacious , so far it must serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties more productive , and of putting it into the power of the government to increase the rate without prejudice to trade . *stop*
The relative situation of these States ; the number of rivers with which they are intersected , and of bays that wash there shores ; the facility of communication in every direction ; the affinity of language and manners ; the familiar habits of intercourse ; -- all these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty , and would insure frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other . *stop*
The separate States or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties . *stop*
The temper of our governments , for a long time to come , would not permit those rigorous precautions by which the European nations guard the avenues into their respective countries , as well by land as by water ; and which , even there , are found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of avarice . *stop*
In France , there is an army of patrols ( as they are called ) constantly employed to secure their fiscal regulations against the inroads of the dealers in contraband trade . *stop*
Mr. Neckar computes the number of these patrols at upwards of twenty thousand . *stop*
This shows the immense difficulty in preventing that species of traffic , where there is an inland communication , and places in a strong light the disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this country would be encumbered , if by disunion the States should be placed in a situation , with respect to each other , resembling that of France with respect to her neighbors . *stop*
The arbitrary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are necessarily armed , would be intolerable in a free country . *stop*
If , on the contrary , there be but one government pervading all the States , there will be , as to the principal part of our commerce , but ONE SIDE to guard -- the ATLANTIC COAST . *stop*
Vessels arriving directly from foreign countries , laden with valuable cargoes , would rarely choose to hazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into port . *stop*
They would have to dread both the dangers of the coast , and of detection , as well after as before their arrival at the places of their final destination . *stop*
An ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue . *stop*
A few armed vessels , judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports , might at a small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws . *stop*
And the government having the same interest to provide against violations everywhere , the co-operation of its measures in each State would have a powerful tendency to render them effectual . *stop*
Here also we should preserve by Union , an advantage which nature holds out to us , and which would be relinquished by separation . *stop*
The United States lie at a great distance from Europe , and at a considerable distance from all other places with which they would have extensive connections of foreign trade . *stop*
The passage from them to us , in a few hours , or in a single night , as between the coasts of France and Britain , and of other neighboring nations , would be impracticable . *stop*
This is a prodigious security against a direct contraband with foreign countries ; but a circuitous contraband to one State , through the medium of another , would be both easy and safe . *stop*
The difference between a direct importation from abroad , and an indirect importation through the channel of a neighboring State , in small parcels , according to time and opportunity , with the additional facilities of inland communication , must be palpable to every man of discernment . *stop*
It is therefore evident , that one national government would be able , at much less expense , to extend the duties on imports , beyond comparison , further than would be practicable to the States separately , or to any partial confederacies . *stop*
Hitherto , I believe , it may safely be asserted , that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three per cent . *stop*
In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent. , and in Britain they exceed this proportion . *stop*
There seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in this country to at least treble their present amount . *stop*
The single article of ardent spirits , under federal regulation , might be made to furnish a considerable revenue . *stop*
Upon a ratio to the importation into this State , the whole quantity imported into the United States may be estimated at four millions of gallons ; which , at a shilling per gallon , would produce two hundred thousand pounds . *stop*
That article would well bear this rate of duty ; and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it , such an effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture , to the economy , to the morals , and to the health of the society . *stop*
There is , perhaps , nothing so much a subject of national extravagance as these spirits . *stop*
What will be the consequence , if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent ? *stop*
A nation can not long exist without revenues . *stop*
Destitute of this essential support , it must resign its independence , and sink into the degraded condition of a province . *stop*
This is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede . *stop*
Revenue , therefore , must be had at all events . *stop*
In this country , if the principal part be not drawn from commerce , it must fall with oppressive weight upon land . *stop*
It has been already intimated that excises , in their true signification , are too little in unison with the feelings of the people , to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation ; nor , indeed , in the States where almost the sole employment is agriculture , are the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very ample collections in that way . *stop*
Personal estate ( as has been before remarked ) , from the difficulty in tracing it , can not be subjected to large contributions , by any other means than by taxes on consumption . *stop*
In populous cities , it may be enough the subject of conjecture , to occasion the oppression of individuals , without much aggregate benefit to the State ; but beyond these circles , it must , in a great measure , escape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer . *stop*
As the necessities of the State , nevertheless , must be satisfied in some mode or other , the defect of other resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on the possessors of land . *stop*
And as , on the other hand , the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate supply , unless all the sources of revenue are open to its demands , the finances of the community , under such embarrassments , can not be put into a situation consistent with its respectability or its security . *stop*
Thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full treasury , to atone for the oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of the soil . *stop*
But public and private distress will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert ; and unite in deploring the infatuation of those counsels which led to disunion . *stop*

13 Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , November 28 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : As CONNECTED with the subject of revenue , we may with propriety consider that of economy . *stop*
The money saved from one object may be usefully applied to another , and there will be so much the less to be drawn from the pockets of the people . *stop*
If the States are united under one government , there will be but one national civil list to support ; if they are divided into several confederacies , there will be as many different national civil lists to be provided for -- and each of them , as to the principal departments , coextensive with that which would be necessary for a government of the whole . *stop*
The entire separation of the States into thirteen unconnected sovereignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many advocates . *stop*
The ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of the empire seem generally turned toward three confederacies -- one consisting of the four Northern , another of the four Middle , and a third of the five Southern States . *stop*
There is little probability that there would be a greater number . *stop*
According to this distribution , each confederacy would comprise an extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great Britain . *stop*
No well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly regulated by a government less comprehensive in its organs or institutions than that which has been proposed by the convention . *stop*
When the dimensions of a State attain to a certain magnitude , it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent . *stop*
This idea admits not of precise demonstration , because there is no rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the government of any given number of individuals ; but when we consider that the island of Britain , nearly commensurate with each of the supposed confederacies , contains about eight millions of people , and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the passions of so large a society to the public good , we shall see no reason to doubt that the like portion of power would be sufficient to perform the same task in a society far more numerous . *stop*
Civil power , properly organized and exerted , is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent ; and can , in a manner , reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions . *stop*
The supposition that each confederacy into which the States would be likely to be divided would require a government not less comprehensive than the one proposed , will be strengthened by another supposition , more probable than that which presents us with three confederacies as the alternative to a general Union . *stop*
If we attend carefully to geographical and commercial considerations , in conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different States , we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most naturally league themselves under two governments . *stop*
The four Eastern States , from all the causes that form the links of national sympathy and connection , may with certainty be expected to unite . *stop*
New York , situated as she is , would never be unwise enough to oppose a feeble and unsupported flank to the weight of that confederacy . *stop*
There are other obvious reasons that would facilitate her accession to it . *stop*
New Jersey is too small a State to think of being a frontier , in opposition to this still more powerful combination ; nor do there appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it . *stop*
Even Pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the Northern league . *stop*
An active foreign commerce , on the basis of her own navigation , is her true policy , and coincides with the opinions and dispositions of her citizens . *stop*
The more Southern States , from various circumstances , may not think themselves much interested in the encouragement of navigation . *stop*
They may prefer a system which would give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their commodities . *stop*
Pennsylvania may not choose to confound her interests in a connection so adverse to her policy . *stop*
As she must at all events be a frontier , she may deem it most consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards the weaker power of the Southern , rather than towards the stronger power of the Northern , Confederacy . *stop*
This would give her the fairest chance to avoid being the Flanders of America . *stop*
Whatever may be the determination of Pennsylvania , if the Northern Confederacy includes New Jersey , there is no likelihood of more than one confederacy to the south of that State . *stop*
Nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen States will be able to support a national government better than one half , or one third , or any number less than the whole . *stop*
This reflection must have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan , which is founded on the principle of expense ; an objection , however , which , when we come to take a nearer view of it , will appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground . *stop*
If , in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil lists , we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily be employed to guard the inland communication between the different confederacies against illicit trade , and who in time will infallibly spring up out of the necessities of revenue ; and if we also take into view the military establishments which it has been shown would unavoidably result from the jealousies and conflicts of the several nations into which the States would be divided , we shall clearly discover that a separation would be not less injurious to the economy , than to the tranquillity , commerce , revenue , and liberty of every part . *stop*

15 The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , December 1 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York . *stop*
IN THE course of the preceding papers , I have endeavored , my fellow citizens , to place before you , in a clear and convincing light , the importance of Union to your political safety and happiness . *stop*
I have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be exposed , should you permit that sacred knot which binds the people of America together be severed or dissolved by ambition or by avarice , by jealousy or by misrepresentation . *stop*
In the sequel of the inquiry through which I propose to accompany you , the truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed . *stop*
If the road over which you will still have to pass should in some places appear to you tedious or irksome , you will recollect that you are in quest of information on a subject the most momentous which can engage the attention of a free people , that the field through which you have to travel is in itself spacious , and that the difficulties of the journey have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which sophistry has beset the way . *stop*
It will be my aim to remove the obstacles from your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be done , without sacrificing utility to despatch . *stop*
In pursuance of the plan which I have laid down for the discussion of the subject , the point next in order to be examined is the '' insufficiency of the present Confederation to the preservation of the Union . '' *stop*
It may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or proof to illustrate a position which is not either controverted or doubted , to which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent , and which in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the friends of the new Constitution . *stop*
It must in truth be acknowledged that , however these may differ in other respects , they in general appear to harmonize in this sentiment , at least , that there are material imperfections in our national system , and that something is necessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy . *stop*
The facts that support this opinion are no longer objects of speculation . *stop*
They have forced themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large , and have at length extorted from those , whose mistaken policy has had the principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are arrived , a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme of our federal government , which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the Union . *stop*
We may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national humiliation . *stop*
There is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do not experience . *stop*
Are there engagements to the performance of which we are held by every tie respectable among men ? *stop*
These are the subjects of constant and unblushing violation . *stop*
Do we owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time of imminent peril for the preservation of our political existence ? *stop*
These remain without any proper or satisfactory provision for their discharge . *stop*
Have we valuable territories and important posts in the possession of a foreign power which , by express stipulations , ought long since to have been surrendered ? *stop*
These are still retained , to the prejudice of our interests , not less than of our rights . *stop*
Are we in a condition to resent or to repel the aggression ? *stop*
We have neither troops , nor treasury , nor government . *stop*
Are we even in a condition to remonstrate with dignity ? *stop*
The just imputations on our own faith , in respect to the same treaty , ought first to be removed . *stop*
Are we entitled by nature and compact to a free participation in the navigation of the Mississippi ? *stop*
Spain excludes us from it . *stop*
Is public credit an indispensable resource in time of public danger ? *stop*
We seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and irretrievable . *stop*
Is commerce of importance to national wealth ? *stop*
Ours is at the lowest point of declension . *stop*
Is respectability in the eyes of foreign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments ? *stop*
The imbecility of our government even forbids them to treat with us . *stop*
Our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty . *stop*
Is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom of national distress ? *stop*
The price of improved land in most parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity of waste land at market , and can only be fully explained by that want of private and public confidence , which are so alarmingly prevalent among all ranks , and which have a direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind . *stop*
Is private credit the friend and patron of industry ? *stop*
That most useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits , and this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity of money . *stop*
To shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford neither pleasure nor instruction , it may in general be demanded , what indication is there of national disorder , poverty , and insignificance that could befall a community so peculiarly blessed with natural advantages as we are , which does not form a part of the dark catalogue of our public misfortunes ? *stop*
This is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those very maxims and councils which would now deter us from adopting the proposed Constitution ; and which , not content with having conducted us to the brink of a precipice , seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss that awaits us below . *stop*
Here , my countrymen , impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people , let us make a firm stand for our safety , our tranquillity , our dignity , our reputation . *stop*
Let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity . *stop*
It is true , as has been before observed that facts , too stubborn to be resisted , have produced a species of general assent to the abstract proposition that there exist material defects in our national system ; but the usefulness of the concession , on the part of the old adversaries of federal measures , is destroyed by a strenuous opposition to a remedy , upon the only principles that can give it a chance of success . *stop*
While they admit that the government of the United States is destitute of energy , they contend against conferring upon it those powers which are requisite to supply that energy . *stop*
They seem still to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable ; at an augmentation of federal authority , without a diminution of State authority ; at sovereignty in the Union , and complete independence in the members . *stop*
They still , in fine , seem to cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium in imperio . *stop*
This renders a full display of the principal defects of the Confederation necessary , in order to show that the evils we experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections , but from fundamental errors in the structure of the building , which can not be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles and main pillars of the fabric . *stop*
The great and radical vice in the construction of the existing Confederation is in the principle of LEGISLATION for STATES or GOVERNMENTS , in their CORPORATE or COLLECTIVE CAPACITIES , and as contradistinguished from the INDIVIDUALS of which they consist . *stop*
Though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the Union , yet it pervades and governs those on which the efficacy of the rest depends . *stop*
Except as to the rule of appointment , the United States has an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and money ; but they have no authority to raise either , by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America . *stop*
The consequence of this is , that though in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws , constitutionally binding on the members of the Union , yet in practice they are mere recommendations which the States observe or disregard at their option . *stop*
It is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human mind , that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head , there should still be found men who object to the new Constitution , for deviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old , and which is in itself evidently incompatible with the idea of GOVERNMENT ; a principle , in short , which , if it is to be executed at all , must substitute the violent and sanguinary agency of the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy . *stop*
There is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time , place , circumstance , and quantity ; leaving nothing to future discretion ; and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties . *stop*
Compacts of this kind exist among all civilized nations , subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war , of observance and non-observance , as the interests or passions of the contracting powers dictate . *stop*
In the early part of the present century there was an epidemical rage in Europe for this species of compacts , from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for benefits which were never realized . *stop*
With a view to establishing the equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the world , all the resources of negotiation were exhausted , and triple and quadruple alliances were formed ; but they were scarcely formed before they were broken , giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to mankind , how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith , and which oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any immediate interest or passion . *stop*
If the particular States in this country are disposed to stand in a similar relation to each other , and to drop the project of a general DISCRETIONARY SUPERINTENDENCE , the scheme would indeed be pernicious , and would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have been enumerated under the first head ; but it would have the merit of being , at least , consistent and practicable Abandoning all views towards a confederate government , this would bring us to a simple alliance offensive and defensive ; and would place us in a situation to be alternate friends and enemies of each other , as our mutual jealousies and rivalships , nourished by the intrigues of foreign nations , should prescribe to us . *stop*
But if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation ; if we still will adhere to the design of a national government , or , which is the same thing , of a superintending power , under the direction of a common council , we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those ingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a league and a government ; we must extend the authority of the Union to the persons of the citizens , -- the only proper objects of government . *stop*
Government implies the power of making laws . *stop*
It is essential to the idea of a law , that it be attended with a sanction ; or , in other words , a penalty or punishment for disobedience . *stop*
If there be no penalty annexed to disobedience , the resolutions or commands which pretend to be laws will , in fact , amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation . *stop*
This penalty , whatever it may be , can only be inflicted in two ways : by the agency of the courts and ministers of justice , or by military force ; by the COERCION of the magistracy , or by the COERCION of arms . *stop*
The first kind can evidently apply only to men ; the last kind must of necessity , be employed against bodies politic , or communities , or States . *stop*
It is evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance of the laws can , in the last resort , be enforced . *stop*
Sentences may be denounced against them for violations of their duty ; but these sentences can only be carried into execution by the sword . *stop*
In an association where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities , that compose it , every breach of the laws must involve a state of war ; and military execution must become the only instrument of civil obedience . *stop*
Such a state of things can certainly not deserve the name of government , nor would any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it . *stop*
There was a time when we were told that breaches , by the States , of the regulations of the federal authority were not to be expected ; that a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of the respective members , and would beget a full compliance with all the constitutional requisitions of the Union . *stop*
This language , at the present day , would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the same quarter will be thought , when we shall have received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom , experience . *stop*
It at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is actuated , and belied the original inducements to the establishment of civil power . *stop*
Why has government been instituted at all ? *stop*
Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice , without constraint . *stop*
Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals ? *stop*
The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind ; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons . *stop*
Regard to reputation has a less active influence , when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one . *stop*
A spirit of faction , which is apt to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men , will often hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses , for which they would blush in a private capacity . *stop*
In addition to all this , there is , in the nature of sovereign power , an impatience of control , that disposes those who are invested with the exercise of it , to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to restrain or direct its operations . *stop*
From this spirit it happens , that in every political association which is formed upon the principle of uniting in a common interest a number of lesser sovereignties , there will be found a kind of eccentric tendency in the subordinate or inferior orbs , by the operation of which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the common centre . *stop*
This tendency is not difficult to be accounted for . *stop*
It has its origin in the love of power . *stop*
Power controlled or abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controlled or abridged . *stop*
This simple proposition will teach us how little reason there is to expect , that the persons intrusted with the administration of the affairs of the particular members of a confederacy will at all times be ready , with perfect good-humor , and an unbiased regard to the public weal , to execute the resolutions or decrees of the general authority . *stop*
The reverse of this results from the constitution of human nature . *stop*
If , therefore , the measures of the Confederacy can not be executed without the intervention of the particular administrations , there will be little prospect of their being executed at all . *stop*
The rulers of the respective members , whether they have a constitutional right to do it or not , will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures themselves . *stop*
They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims ; the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption . *stop*
All this will be done ; and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny , without that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state , which is essential to a right judgment , and with that strong predilection in favor of local objects , which can hardly fail to mislead the decision . *stop*
The same process must be repeated in every member of which the body is constituted ; and the execution of the plans , framed by the councils of the whole , will always fluctuate on the discretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part . *stop*
Those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies ; who have seen how difficult it often is , where there is no exterior pressure of circumstances , to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important points , will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a number of such assemblies , deliberating at a distance from each other , at different times , and under different impressions , long to co-operate in the same views and pursuits . *stop*
In our case , the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is requisite , under the Confederation , to the complete execution of every important measure that proceeds from the Union . *stop*
It has happened as was to have been foreseen . *stop*
The measures of the Union have not been executed ; the delinquencies of the States have , step by step , matured themselves to an extreme , which has , at length , arrested all the wheels of the national government , and brought them to an awful stand . *stop*
Congress at this time scarcely possess the means of keeping up the forms of administration , till the States can have time to agree upon a more substantial substitute for the present shadow of a federal government . *stop*
Things did not come to this desperate extremity at once . *stop*
The causes which have been specified produced at first only unequal and disproportionate degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the Union . *stop*
The greater deficiencies of some States furnished the pretext of example and the temptation of interest to the complying , or to the least delinquent States . *stop*
Why should we do more in proportion than those who are embarked with us in the same political voyage ? *stop*
Why should we consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden ? *stop*
These were suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand , and which even speculative men , who looked forward to remote consequences , could not , without hesitation , combat . *stop*
Each State , yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest or convenience , has successively withdrawn its support , till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads , and to crush us beneath its ruins . *stop*

16 The Same Subject Continued ( The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union ) From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , December 4 , 1787 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE tendency of the principle of legislation for States , or communities , in their political capacities , as it has been exemplified by the experiment we have made of it , is equally attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of the confederate kind , of which we have any account , in exact proportion to its prevalence in those systems . *stop*
The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a distinct and particular examination . *stop*
I shall content myself with barely observing here , that of all the confederacies of antiquity , which history has handed down to us , the Lycian and Achaean leagues , as far as there remain vestiges of them , appear to have been most free from the fetters of that mistaken principle , and were accordingly those which have best deserved , and have most liberally received , the applauding suffrages of political writers . *stop*
This exceptionable principle may , as truly as emphatically , be styled the parent of anarchy : It has been seen that delinquencies in the members of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring ; and that whenever they happen , the only constitutional remedy is force , and the immediate effect of the use of it , civil war . *stop*
It remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government , in its application to us , would even be capable of answering its end . *stop*
If there should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of the national government it would either not be able to employ force at all , or , when this could be done , it would amount to a war between parts of the Confederacy concerning the infractions of a league , in which the strongest combination would be most likely to prevail , whether it consisted of those who supported or of those who resisted the general authority . *stop*
It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redressed would be confined to a single member , and if there were more than one who had neglected their duty , similarity of situation would induce them to unite for common defense . *stop*
Independent of this motive of sympathy , if a large and influential State should happen to be the aggressing member , it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over some of them as associates to its cause . *stop*
Specious arguments of danger to the common liberty could easily be contrived ; plausible excuses for the deficiencies of the party could , without difficulty , be invented to alarm the apprehensions , inflame the passions , and conciliate the good-will , even of those States which were not chargeable with any violation or omission of duty . *stop*
This would be the more likely to take place , as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers , with a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement ; the better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent States . *stop*
If associates could not be found at home , recourse would be had to the aid of foreign powers , who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the dissensions of a Confederacy , from the firm union of which they had so much to fear . *stop*
When the sword is once drawn , the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation . *stop*
The suggestions of wounded pride , the instigations of irritated resentment , would be apt to carry the States against which the arms of the Union were exerted , to any extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of submission . *stop*
The first war of this kind would probably terminate in a dissolution of the Union . *stop*
This may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy . *stop*
Its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing , if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form . *stop*
It is not probable , considering the genius of this country , that the complying States would often be inclined to support the authority of the Union by engaging in a war against the non-complying States . *stop*
They would always be more ready to pursue the milder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with the delinquent members by an imitation of their example . *stop*
And the guilt of all would thus become the security of all . *stop*
Our past experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its full light . *stop*
There would , in fact , be an insuperable difficulty in ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed . *stop*
In the article of pecuniary contribution , which would be the most usual source of delinquency , it would often be impossible to decide whether it had proceeded from disinclination or inability . *stop*
The pretense of the latter would always be at hand . *stop*
And the case must be very flagrant in which its fallacy could be detected with sufficient certainty to justify the harsh expedient of compulsion . *stop*
It is easy to see that this problem alone , as often as it should occur , would open a wide field for the exercise of factious views , of partiality , and of oppression , in the majority that happened to prevail in the national council . *stop*
It seems to require no pains to prove that the States ought not to prefer a national Constitution which could only be kept in motion by the instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to execute the ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government . *stop*
And yet this is the plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny it the power of extending its operations to individuals . *stop*
Such a scheme , if practicable at all , would instantly degenerate into a military despotism ; but it will be found in every light impracticable . *stop*
The resources of the Union would not be equal to the maintenance of an army considerable enough to confine the larger States within the limits of their duty ; nor would the means ever be furnished of forming such an army in the first instance . *stop*
Whoever considers the populousness and strength of several of these States singly at the present juncture , and looks forward to what they will become , even at the distance of half a century , will at once dismiss as idle and visionary any scheme which aims at regulating their movements by laws to operate upon them in their collective capacities , and to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in the same capacities . *stop*
A project of this kind is little less romantic than the monster-taming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous heroes and demi-gods of antiquity . *stop*
Even in those confederacies which have been composed of members smaller than many of our counties , the principle of legislation for sovereign States , supported by military coercion , has never been found effectual . *stop*
It has rarely been attempted to be employed , but against the weaker members ; and in most instances attempts to coerce the refractory and disobedient have been the signals of bloody wars , in which one half of the confederacy has displayed its banners against the other half . *stop*
The result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be clearly this , that if it be possible at any rate to construct a federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and preserving the general tranquillity , it must be founded , as to the objects committed to its care , upon the reverse of the principle contended for by the opponents of the proposed Constitution . *stop*
It must carry its agency to the persons of the citizens . *stop*
It must stand in need of no intermediate legislations ; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions . *stop*
The majesty of the national authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts of justice . *stop*
The government of the Union , like that of each State , must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals ; and to attract to its support those passions which have the strongest influence upon the human heart . *stop*
It must , in short , possess all the means , and have aright to resort to all the methods , of executing the powers with which it is intrusted , that are possessed and exercised by the government of the particular States . *stop*
To this reasoning it may perhaps be objected , that if any State should be disaffected to the authority of the Union , it could at any time obstruct the execution of its laws , and bring the matter to the same issue of force , with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is reproached . *stop*
The plausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we advert to the essential difference between a mere NON-COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and ACTIVE RESISTANCE . *stop*
If the interposition of the State legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union , they have only NOT TO ACT , or TO ACT EVASIVELY , and the measure is defeated . *stop*
This neglect of duty may be disguised under affected but unsubstantial provisions , so as not to appear , and of course not to excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the Constitution . *stop*
The State leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious invasions of it on the ground of some temporary convenience , exemption , or advantage . *stop*
But if the execution of the laws of the national government should not require the intervention of the State legislatures , if they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens themselves , the particular governments could not interrupt their progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional power . *stop*
No omissions nor evasions would answer the end . *stop*
They would be obliged to act , and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights . *stop*
An experiment of this nature would always be hazardous in the face of a constitution in any degree competent to its own defense , and of a people enlightened enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal usurpation of authority . *stop*
The success of it would require not merely a factious majority in the legislature , but the concurrence of the courts of justice and of the body of the people . *stop*
If the judges were not embarked in a conspiracy with the legislature , they would pronounce the resolutions of such a majority to be contrary to the supreme law of the land , unconstitutional , and void . *stop*
If the people were not tainted with the spirit of their State representatives , they , as the natural guardians of the Constitution , would throw their weight into the national scale and give it a decided preponderancy in the contest . *stop*
Attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or rashness , because they could seldom be made without danger to the authors , unless in cases of a tyrannical exercise of the federal authority . *stop*
If opposition to the national government should arise from the disorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals , it could be overcome by the same means which are daily employed against the same evil under the State governments . *stop*
The magistracy , being equally the ministers of the law of the land , from whatever source it might emanate , would doubtless be as ready to guard the national as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiousness . *stop*
As to those partial commotions and insurrections , which sometimes disquiet society , from the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction , or from sudden or occasional illhumors that do not infect the great body of the community the general government could command more extensive resources for the suppression of disturbances of that kind than would be in the power of any single member . *stop*
And as to those mortal feuds which , in certain conjunctures , spread a conflagration through a whole nation , or through a very large proportion of it , proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the government or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxysm , they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation . *stop*
When they happen , they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments of empire . *stop*
No form of government can always either avoid or control them . *stop*
It is in vain to hope to guard against events too mighty for human foresight or precaution , and it would be idle to object to a government because it could not perform impossibilities . *stop*

17 The Same Subject Continued ( The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union ) For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , December 5 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : AN OBJECTION , of a nature different from that which has been stated and answered , in my last address , may perhaps be likewise urged against the principle of legislation for the individual citizens of America . *stop*
It may be said that it would tend to render the government of the Union too powerful , and to enable it to absorb those residuary authorities , which it might be judged proper to leave with the States for local purposes . *stop*
Allowing the utmost latitude to the love of power which any reasonable man can require , I confess I am at a loss to discover what temptation the persons intrusted with the administration of the general government could ever feel to divest the States of the authorities of that description . *stop*
The regulation of the mere domestic police of a State appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition . *stop*
Commerce , finance , negotiation , and war seem to comprehend all the objects which have charms for minds governed by that passion ; and all the powers necessary to those objects ought , in the first instance , to be lodged in the national depository . *stop*
The administration of private justice between the citizens of the same State , the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a similar nature , all those things , in short , which are proper to be provided for by local legislation , can never be desirable cares of a general jurisdiction . *stop*
It is therefore improbable that there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with which they are connected ; because the attempt to exercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory ; and the possession of them , for that reason , would contribute nothing to the dignity , to the importance , or to the splendor of the national government . *stop*
But let it be admitted , for argument 's sake , that mere wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that disposition ; still it may be safely affirmed , that the sense of the constituent body of the national representatives , or , in other words , the people of the several States , would control the indulgence of so extravagant an appetite . *stop*
It will always be far more easy for the State governments to encroach upon the national authorities than for the national government to encroach upon the State authorities . *stop*
The proof of this proposition turns upon the greater degree of influence which the State governments if they administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence , will generally possess over the people ; a circumstance which at the same time teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in all federal constitutions ; and that too much pains can not be taken in their organization , to give them all the force which is compatible with the principles of liberty . *stop*
The superiority of influence in favor of the particular governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of the national government , but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the attention of the State administrations would be directed . *stop*
It is a known fact in human nature , that its affections are commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the object . *stop*
Upon the same principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his neighborhood , to his neighborhood than to the community at large , the people of each State would be apt to feel a stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the government of the Union ; unless the force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter . *stop*
This strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful auxiliaries in the objects of State regulation . *stop*
The variety of more minute interests , which will necessarily fall under the superintendence of the local administrations , and which will form so many rivulets of influence , running through every part of the society , can not be particularized , without involving a detail too tedious and uninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might afford . *stop*
There is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of the State governments , which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light , -- I mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice . *stop*
This , of all others , is the most powerful , most universal , and most attractive source of popular obedience and attachment . *stop*
It is that which , being the immediate and visible guardian of life and property , having its benefits and its terrors in constant activity before the public eye , regulating all those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more immediately awake , contributes , more than any other circumstance , to impressing upon the minds of the people , affection , esteem , and reverence towards the government . *stop*
This great cement of society , which will diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the particular governments , independent of all other causes of influence , would insure them so decided an empire over their respective citizens as to render them at all times a complete counterpoise , and , not unfrequently , dangerous rivals to the power of the Union . *stop*
The operations of the national government , on the other hand , falling less immediately under the observation of the mass of the citizens , the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by speculative men . *stop*
Relating to more general interests , they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the people ; and , in proportion , less likely to inspire an habitual sense of obligation , and an active sentiment of attachment . *stop*
The reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the experience of all federal constitutions with which we are acquainted , and of all others which have borne the least analogy to them . *stop*
Though the ancient feudal systems were not , strictly speaking , confederacies , yet they partook of the nature of that species of association . *stop*
There was a common head , chieftain , or sovereign , whose authority extended over the whole nation ; and a number of subordinate vassals , or feudatories , who had large portions of land allotted to them , and numerous trains of INFERIOR vassals or retainers , who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience , to the persons of whom they held it . *stop*
Each principal vassal was a kind of sovereign , within his particular demesnes . *stop*
The consequences of this situation were a continual opposition to authority of the sovereign , and frequent wars between the great barons or chief feudatories themselves . *stop*
The power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak , either to preserve the public peace , or to protect the people against the oppressions of their immediate lords . *stop*
This period of European affairs is emphatically styled by historians , the times of feudal anarchy . *stop*
When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper and of superior abilities , he would acquire a personal weight and influence , which answered , for the time , the purpose of a more regular authority . *stop*
But in general , the power of the barons triumphed over that of the prince ; and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown off , and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or States . *stop*
In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his vassals , his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their dependents . *stop*
The barons , or nobles , equally the enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people , were dreaded and detested by both ; till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy . *stop*
Had the nobles , by a conduct of clemency and justice , preserved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers , the contests between them and the prince must almost always have ended in their favor , and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal authority . *stop*
This is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture . *stop*
Among other illustrations of its truth which might be cited , Scotland will furnish a cogent example . *stop*
The spirit of clanship which was , at an early day , introduced into that kingdom , uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to those of kindred , rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch , till the incorporation with England subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit , and reduced it within those rules of subordination which a more rational and more energetic system of civil polity had previously established in the latter kingdom . *stop*
The separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with the feudal baronies ; with this advantage in their favor , that from the reasons already explained , they will generally possess the confidence and good-will of the people , and with so important a support , will be able effectually to oppose all encroachments of the national government . *stop*
It will be well if they are not able to counteract its legitimate and necessary authority . *stop*
The points of similitude consist in the rivalship of power , applicable to both , and in the CONCENTRATION of large portions of the strength of the community into particular DEPOSITORIES , in one case at the disposal of individuals , in the other case at the disposal of political bodies . *stop*
A concise review of the events that have attended confederate governments will further illustrate this important doctrine ; an inattention to which has been the great source of our political mistakes , and has given our jealousy a direction to the wrong side . *stop*
This review shall form the subject of some ensuing papers . *stop*

21 Other Defects of the Present Confederation For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , December 12 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : HAVING in the three last numbers taken a summary review of the principal circumstances and events which have depicted the genius and fate of other confederate governments , I shall now proceed in the enumeration of the most important of those defects which have hitherto disappointed our hopes from the system established among ourselves . *stop*
To form a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper remedy , it is absolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted with the extent and malignity of the disease . *stop*
The next most palpable defect of the subsisting Confederation , is the total want of a SANCTION to its laws . *stop*
The United States , as now composed , have no powers to exact obedience , or punish disobedience to their resolutions , either by pecuniary mulcts , by a suspension or divestiture of privileges , or by any other constitutional mode . *stop*
There is no express delegation of authority to them to use force against delinquent members ; and if such a right should be ascribed to the federal head , as resulting from the nature of the social compact between the States , it must be by inference and construction , in the face of that part of the second article , by which it is declared , `` that each State shall retain every power , jurisdiction , and right , not EXPRESSLY delegated to the United States in Congress assembled . '' *stop*
There is , doubtless , a striking absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist , but we are reduced to the dilemma either of embracing that supposition , preposterous as it may seem , or of contravening or explaining away a provision , which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies of those who oppose the new Constitution ; and the want of which , in that plan , has been the subject of much plausible animadversion , and severe criticism . *stop*
If we are unwilling to impair the force of this applauded provision , we shall be obliged to conclude , that the United States afford the extraordinary spectacle of a government destitute even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the execution of its own laws . *stop*
It will appear , from the specimens which have been cited , that the American Confederacy , in this particular , stands discriminated from every other institution of a similar kind , and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world . *stop*
The want of a mutual guaranty of the State governments is another capital imperfection in the federal plan . *stop*
There is nothing of this kind declared in the articles that compose it ; and to imply a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility , would be a still more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned , than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations . *stop*
The want of a guaranty , though it might in its consequences endanger the Union , does not so immediately attack its existence as the want of a constitutional sanction to its laws . *stop*
Without a guaranty the assistance to be derived from the Union in repelling those domestic dangers which may sometimes threaten the existence of the State constitutions , must be renounced . *stop*
Usurpation may rear its crest in each State , and trample upon the liberties of the people , while the national government could legally do nothing more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret . *stop*
A successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law , while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the Union to the friends and supporters of the government . *stop*
The tempestuous situation from which Massachusetts has scarcely emerged , evinces that dangers of this kind are not merely speculative . *stop*
Who can determine what might have been the issue of her late convulsions , if the malcontents had been headed by a Caesar or by a Cromwell ? *stop*
Who can predict what effect a despotism , established in Massachusetts , would have upon the liberties of New Hampshire or Rhode Island , of Connecticut or New York ? *stop*
The inordinate pride of State importance has suggested to some minds an objection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal government , as involving an officious interference in the domestic concerns of the members . *stop*
A scruple of this kind would deprive us of one of the principal advantages to be expected from union , and can only flow from a misapprehension of the nature of the provision itself . *stop*
It could be no impediment to reforms of the State constitution by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable mode . *stop*
This right would remain undiminished . *stop*
The guaranty could only operate against changes to be effected by violence . *stop*
Towards the preventions of calamities of this kind , too many checks can not be provided . *stop*
The peace of society and the stability of government depend absolutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this head . *stop*
Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people , there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State . *stop*
The natural cure for an ill-administration , in a popular or representative constitution , is a change of men . *stop*
A guaranty by the national authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations of rulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and sedition in the community . *stop*
The principle of regulating the contributions of the States to the common treasury by QUOTAS is another fundamental error in the Confederation . *stop*
Its repugnancy to an adequate supply of the national exigencies has been already pointed out , and has sufficiently appeared from the trial which has been made of it . *stop*
I speak of it now solely with a view to equality among the States . *stop*
Those who have been accustomed to contemplate the circumstances which produce and constitute national wealth , must be satisfied that there is no common standard or barometer by which the degrees of it can be ascertained . *stop*
Neither the value of lands , nor the numbers of the people , which have been successively proposed as the rule of State contributions , has any pretension to being a just representative . *stop*
If we compare the wealth of the United Netherlands with that of Russia or Germany , or even of France , and if we at the same time compare the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of that contracted district with the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of the immense regions of either of the three last-mentioned countries , we shall at once discover that there is no comparison between the proportion of either of these two objects and that of the relative wealth of those nations . *stop*
If the like parallel were to be run between several of the American States , it would furnish a like result . *stop*
Let Virginia be contrasted with North Carolina , Pennsylvania with Connecticut , or Maryland with New Jersey , and we shall be convinced that the respective abilities of those States , in relation to revenue , bear little or no analogy to their comparative stock in lands or to their comparative population . *stop*
The position may be equally illustrated by a similar process between the counties of the same State . *stop*
No man who is acquainted with the State of New York will doubt that the active wealth of King 's County bears a much greater proportion to that of Montgomery than it would appear to be if we should take either the total value of the lands or the total number of the people as a criterion ! *stop*
The wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of causes . *stop*
Situation , soil , climate , the nature of the productions , the nature of the government , the genius of the citizens , the degree of information they possess , the state of commerce , of arts , of industry , these circumstances and many more , too complex , minute , or adventitious to admit of a particular specification , occasion differences hardly conceivable in the relative opulence and riches of different countries . *stop*
The consequence clearly is that there can be no common measure of national wealth , and , of course , no general or stationary rule by which the ability of a state to pay taxes can be determined . *stop*
The attempt , therefore , to regulate the contributions of the members of a confederacy by any such rule , can not fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme oppression . *stop*
This inequality would of itself be sufficient in America to work the eventual destruction of the Union , if any mode of enforcing a compliance with its requisitions could be devised . *stop*
The suffering States would not long consent to remain associated upon a principle which distributes the public burdens with so unequal a hand , and which was calculated to impoverish and oppress the citizens of some States , while those of others would scarcely be conscious of the small proportion of the weight they were required to sustain . *stop*
This , however , is an evil inseparable from the principle of quotas and requisitions . *stop*
There is no method of steering clear of this inconvenience , but by authorizing the national government to raise its own revenues in its own way . *stop*
Imposts , excises , and , in general , all duties upon articles of consumption , may be compared to a fluid , which will , in time , find its level with the means of paying them . *stop*
The amount to be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own option , and can be regulated by an attention to his resources . *stop*
The rich may be extravagant , the poor can be frugal ; and private oppression may always be avoided by a judicious selection of objects proper for such impositions . *stop*
If inequalities should arise in some States from duties on particular objects , these will , in all probability , be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in other States , from the duties on other objects . *stop*
In the course of time and things , an equilibrium , as far as it is attainable in so complicated a subject , will be established everywhere . *stop*
Or , if inequalities should still exist , they would neither be so great in their degree , so uniform in their operation , nor so odious in their appearance , as those which would necessarily spring from quotas , upon any scale that can possibly be devised . *stop*
It is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption , that they contain in their own nature a security against excess . *stop*
They prescribe their own limit ; which can not be exceeded without defeating the end proposed , that is , an extension of the revenue . *stop*
When applied to this object , the saying is as just as it is witty , that , `` in political arithmetic , two and two do not always make four . '' *stop*
If duties are too high , they lessen the consumption ; the collection is eluded ; and the product to the treasury is not so great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds . *stop*
This forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of the citizens by taxes of this class , and is itself a natural limitation of the power of imposing them . *stop*
Impositions of this kind usually fall under the denomination of indirect taxes , and must for a long time constitute the chief part of the revenue raised in this country . *stop*
Those of the direct kind , which principally relate to land and buildings , may admit of a rule of apportionment . *stop*
Either the value of land , or the number of the people , may serve as a standard . *stop*
The state of agriculture and the populousness of a country have been considered as nearly connected with each other . *stop*
And , as a rule , for the purpose intended , numbers , in the view of simplicity and certainty , are entitled to a preference . *stop*
In every country it is a herculean task to obtain a valuation of the land ; in a country imperfectly settled and progressive in improvement , the difficulties are increased almost to impracticability . *stop*
The expense of an accurate valuation is , in all situations , a formidable objection . *stop*
In a branch of taxation where no limits to the discretion of the government are to be found in the nature of things , the establishment of a fixed rule , not incompatible with the end , may be attended with fewer inconveniences than to leave that discretion altogether at large . *stop*

22 The Same Subject Continued ( Other Defects of the Present Confederation ) From the New York Packet . *stop*
Friday , December 14 , 1787 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IN ADDITION to the defects already enumerated in the existing federal system , there are others of not less importance , which concur in rendering it altogether unfit for the administration of the affairs of the Union . *stop*
The want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to be of the number . *stop*
The utility of such a power has been anticipated under the first head of our inquiries ; and for this reason , as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon the subject , little need be added in this place . *stop*
It is indeed evident , on the most superficial view , that there is no object , either as it respects the interests of trade or finance , that more strongly demands a federal superintendence . *stop*
The want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers , and has given occasions of dissatisfaction between the States . *stop*
No nation acquainted with the nature of our political association would be unwise enough to enter into stipulations with the United States , by which they conceded privileges of any importance to them , while they were apprised that the engagements on the part of the Union might at any moment be violated by its members , and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets , without granting us any return but such as their momentary convenience might suggest . *stop*
It is not , therefore , to be wondered at that Mr. Jenkinson , in ushering into the House of Commons a bill for regulating the temporary intercourse between the two countries , should preface its introduction by a declaration that similar provisions in former bills had been found to answer every purpose to the commerce of Great Britain , and that it would be prudent to persist in the plan until it should appear whether the American government was likely or not to acquire greater consistency . *stop*
Several States have endeavored , by separate prohibitions , restrictions , and exclusions , to influence the conduct of that kingdom in this particular , but the want of concert , arising from the want of a general authority and from clashing and dissimilar views in the State , has hitherto frustrated every experiment of the kind , and will continue to do so as long as the same obstacles to a uniformity of measures continue to exist . *stop*
The interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States , contrary to the true spirit of the Union , have , in different instances , given just cause of umbrage and complaint to others , and it is to be feared that examples of this nature , if not restrained by a national control , would be multiplied and extended till they became not less serious sources of animosity and discord than injurious impediments to the intercourse between the different parts of the Confederacy . *stop*
`` The commerce of the German empire is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing through their territories , by means of which the fine streams and navigable rivers with which Germany is so happily watered are rendered almost useless . '' *stop*
Though the genius of the people of this country might never permit this description to be strictly applicable to us , yet we may reasonably expect , from the gradual conflicts of State regulations , that the citizens of each would at length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens . *stop*
The power of raising armies , by the most obvious construction of the articles of the Confederation , is merely a power of making requisitions upon the States for quotas of men . *stop*
This practice in the course of the late war , was found replete with obstructions to a vigorous and to an economical system of defense . *stop*
It gave birth to a competition between the States which created a kind of auction for men . *stop*
In order to furnish the quotas required of them , they outbid each other till bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size . *stop*
The hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their enlistment , and disinclined them from engaging for any considerable periods . *stop*
Hence , slow and scanty levies of men , in the most critical emergencies of our affairs ; short enlistments at an unparalleled expense ; continual fluctuations in the troops , ruinous to their discipline and subjecting the public safety frequently to the perilous crisis of a disbanded army . *stop*
Hence , also , those oppressive expedients for raising men which were upon several occasions practiced , and which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would have induced the people to endure . *stop*
This method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to economy and vigor than it is to an equal distribution of the burden . *stop*
The States near the seat of war , influenced by motives of self-preservation , made efforts to furnish their quotas , which even exceeded their abilities ; while those at a distance from danger were , for the most part , as remiss as the others were diligent , in their exertions . *stop*
The immediate pressure of this inequality was not in this case , as in that of the contributions of money , alleviated by the hope of a final liquidation . *stop*
The States which did not pay their proportions of money might at least be charged with their deficiencies ; but no account could be formed of the deficiencies in the supplies of men . *stop*
We shall not , however , see much reason to regret the want of this hope , when we consider how little prospect there is , that the most delinquent States will ever be able to make compensation for their pecuniary failures . *stop*
The system of quotas and requisitions , whether it be applied to men or money , is , in every view , a system of imbecility in the Union , and of inequality and injustice among the members . *stop*
The right of equal suffrage among the States is another exceptionable part of the Confederation . *stop*
Every idea of proportion and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a principle , which gives to Rhode Island an equal weight in the scale of power with Massachusetts , or Connecticut , or New York ; and to Delaware an equal voice in the national deliberations with Pennsylvania , or Virginia , or North Carolina . *stop*
Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government , which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail . *stop*
Sophistry may reply , that sovereigns are equal , and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America . *stop*
But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common-sense . *stop*
It may happen that this majority of States is a small minority of the people of America ; and two thirds of the people of America could not long be persuaded , upon the credit of artificial distinctions and syllogistic subtleties , to submit their interests to the management and disposal of one third . *stop*
The larger States would after a while revolt from the idea of receiving the law from the smaller . *stop*
To acquiesce in such a privation of their due importance in the political scale , would be not merely to be insensible to the love of power , but even to sacrifice the desire of equality . *stop*
It is neither rational to expect the first , nor just to require the last . *stop*
The smaller States , considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare depend on union , ought readily to renounce a pretension which , if not relinquished , would prove fatal to its duration . *stop*
It may be objected to this , that not seven but nine States , or two thirds of the whole number , must consent to the most important resolutions ; and it may be thence inferred that nine States would always comprehend a majority of the Union . *stop*
But this does not obviate the impropriety of an equal vote between States of the most unequal dimensions and populousness ; nor is the inference accurate in point of fact ; for we can enumerate nine States which contain less than a majority of the people ; and it is constitutionally possible that these nine may give the vote . *stop*
Besides , there are matters of considerable moment determinable by a bare majority ; and there are others , concerning which doubts have been entertained , which , if interpreted in favor of the sufficiency of a vote of seven States , would extend its operation to interests of the first magnitude . *stop*
In addition to this , it is to be observed that there is a probability of an increase in the number of States , and no provision for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes . *stop*
But this is not all : what at first sight may seem a remedy , is , in reality , a poison . *stop*
To give a minority a negative upon the majority ( which is always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a decision ) , is , in its tendency , to subject the sense of the greater number to that of the lesser . *stop*
Congress , from the nonattendance of a few States , have been frequently in the situation of a Polish diet , where a single VOTE has been sufficient to put a stop to all their movements . *stop*
A sixtieth part of the Union , which is about the proportion of Delaware and Rhode Island , has several times been able to oppose an entire bar to its operations . *stop*
This is one of those refinements which , in practice , has an effect the reverse of what is expected from it in theory . *stop*
The necessity of unanimity in public bodies , or of something approaching towards it , has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security . *stop*
But its real operation is to embarrass the administration , to destroy the energy of the government , and to substitute the pleasure , caprice , or artifices of an insignificant , turbulent , or corrupt junto , to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority . *stop*
In those emergencies of a nation , in which the goodness or badness , the weakness or strength of its government , is of the greatest importance , there is commonly a necessity for action . *stop*
The public business must , in some way or other , go forward . *stop*
If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority , respecting the best mode of conducting it , the majority , in order that something may be done , must conform to the views of the minority ; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater , and give a tone to the national proceedings . *stop*
Hence , tedious delays ; continual negotiation and intrigue ; contemptible compromises of the public good . *stop*
And yet , in such a system , it is even happy when such compromises can take place : for upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation ; and then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended , or fatally defeated . *stop*
It is often , by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes , kept in a state of inaction . *stop*
Its situation must always savor of weakness , sometimes border upon anarchy . *stop*
It is not difficult to discover , that a principle of this kind gives greater scope to foreign corruption , as well as to domestic faction , than that which permits the sense of the majority to decide ; though the contrary of this has been presumed . *stop*
The mistake has proceeded from not attending with due care to the mischiefs that may be occasioned by obstructing the progress of government at certain critical seasons . *stop*
When the concurrence of a large number is required by the Constitution to the doing of any national act , we are apt to rest satisfied that all is safe , because nothing improper will be likely TO BE DONE , but we forget how much good may be prevented , and how much ill may be produced , by the power of hindering the doing what may be necessary , and of keeping affairs in the same unfavorable posture in which they may happen to stand at particular periods . *stop*
Suppose , for instance , we were engaged in a war , in conjunction with one foreign nation , against another . *stop*
Suppose the necessity of our situation demanded peace , and the interest or ambition of our ally led him to seek the prosecution of the war , with views that might justify us in making separate terms . *stop*
In such a state of things , this ally of ours would evidently find it much easier , by his bribes and intrigues , to tie up the hands of government from making peace , where two thirds of all the votes were requisite to that object , than where a simple majority would suffice . *stop*
In the first case , he would have to corrupt a smaller number ; in the last , a greater number . *stop*
Upon the same principle , it would be much easier for a foreign power with which we were at war to perplex our councils and embarrass our exertions . *stop*
And , in a commercial view , we may be subjected to similar inconveniences . *stop*
A nation , with which we might have a treaty of commerce , could with much greater facility prevent our forming a connection with her competitor in trade , though such a connection should be ever so beneficial to ourselves . *stop*
Evils of this description ought not to be regarded as imaginary . *stop*
One of the weak sides of republics , among their numerous advantages , is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption . *stop*
An hereditary monarch , though often disposed to sacrifice his subjects to his ambition , has so great a personal interest in the government and in the external glory of the nation , that it is not easy for a foreign power to give him an equivalent for what he would sacrifice by treachery to the state . *stop*
The world has accordingly been witness to few examples of this species of royal prostitution , though there have been abundant specimens of every other kind . *stop*
In republics , persons elevated from the mass of the community , by the suffrages of their fellow-citizens , to stations of great pre-eminence and power , may find compensations for betraying their trust , which , to any but minds animated and guided by superior virtue , may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in the common stock , and to overbalance the obligations of duty . *stop*
Hence it is that history furnishes us with so many mortifying examples of the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments . *stop*
How much this contributed to the ruin of the ancient commonwealths has been already delineated . *stop*
It is well known that the deputies of the United Provinces have , in various instances , been purchased by the emissaries of the neighboring kingdoms . *stop*
The Earl of Chesterfield ( if my memory serves me right ) , in a letter to his court , intimates that his success in an important negotiation must depend on his obtaining a major 's commission for one of those deputies . *stop*
And in Sweden the parties were alternately bought by France and England in so barefaced and notorious a manner that it excited universal disgust in the nation , and was a principal cause that the most limited monarch in Europe , in a single day , without tumult , violence , or opposition , became one of the most absolute and uncontrolled . *stop*
A circumstance which crowns the defects of the Confederation remains yet to be mentioned , the want of a judiciary power . *stop*
Laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation . *stop*
The treaties of the United States , to have any force at all , must be considered as part of the law of the land . *stop*
Their true import , as far as respects individuals , must , like all other laws , be ascertained by judicial determinations . *stop*
To produce uniformity in these determinations , they ought to be submitted , in the last resort , to one SUPREME TRIBUNAL . *stop*
And this tribunal ought to be instituted under the same authority which forms the treaties themselves . *stop*
These ingredients are both indispensable . *stop*
If there is in each State a court of final jurisdiction , there may be as many different final determinations on the same point as there are courts . *stop*
There are endless diversities in the opinions of men . *stop*
We often see not only different courts but the judges of the came court differing from each other . *stop*
To avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories , all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest , possessing a general superintendence , and authorized to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice . *stop*
This is the more necessary where the frame of the government is so compounded that the laws of the whole are in danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts . *stop*
In this case , if the particular tribunals are invested with a right of ultimate jurisdiction , besides the contradictions to be expected from difference of opinion , there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices , and from the interference of local regulations . *stop*
As often as such an interference was to happen , there would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the particular laws might be preferred to those of the general laws ; for nothing is more natural to men in office than to look with peculiar deference towards that authority to which they owe their official existence . *stop*
The treaties of the United States , under the present Constitution , are liable to the infractions of thirteen different legislatures , and as many different courts of final jurisdiction , acting under the authority of those legislatures . *stop*
The faith , the reputation , the peace of the whole Union , are thus continually at the mercy of the prejudices , the passions , and the interests of every member of which it is composed . *stop*
Is it possible that foreign nations can either respect or confide in such a government ? *stop*
Is it possible that the people of America will longer consent to trust their honor , their happiness , their safety , on so precarious a foundation ? *stop*
In this review of the Confederation , I have confined myself to the exhibition of its most material defects ; passing over those imperfections in its details by which even a great part of the power intended to be conferred upon it has been in a great measure rendered abortive . *stop*
It must be by this time evident to all men of reflection , who can divest themselves of the prepossessions of preconceived opinions , that it is a system so radically vicious and unsound , as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its leading features and characters . *stop*
The organization of Congress is itself utterly improper for the exercise of those powers which are necessary to be deposited in the Union . *stop*
A single assembly may be a proper receptacle of those slender , or rather fettered , authorities , which have been heretofore delegated to the federal head ; but it would be inconsistent with all the principles of good government , to intrust it with those additional powers which , even the moderate and more rational adversaries of the proposed Constitution admit , ought to reside in the United States . *stop*
If that plan should not be adopted , and if the necessity of the Union should be able to withstand the ambitious aims of those men who may indulge magnificent schemes of personal aggrandizement from its dissolution , the probability would be , that we should run into the project of conferring supplementary powers upon Congress , as they are now constituted ; and either the machine , from the intrinsic feebleness of its structure , will moulder into pieces , in spite of our ill-judged efforts to prop it ; or , by successive augmentations of its force an energy , as necessity might prompt , we shall finally accumulate , in a single body , all the most important prerogatives of sovereignty , and thus entail upon our posterity one of the most execrable forms of government that human infatuation ever contrived . *stop*
Thus , we should create in reality that very tyranny which the adversaries of the new Constitution either are , or affect to be , solicitous to avert . *stop*
It has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the existing federal system , that it never had a ratification by the PEOPLE . *stop*
Resting on no better foundation than the consent of the several legislatures , it has been exposed to frequent and intricate questions concerning the validity of its powers , and has , in some instances , given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of legislative repeal . *stop*
Owing its ratification to the law of a State , it has been contended that the same authority might repeal the law by which it was ratified . *stop*
However gross a heresy it may be to maintain that a PARTY to a COMPACT has a right to revoke that COMPACT , the doctrine itself has had respectable advocates . *stop*
The possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity of laying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated authority . *stop*
The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid basis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE . *stop*
The streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure , original fountain of all legitimate authority . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
23 The Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to the Preservation of the Union From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , December 18 , 1787 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE necessity of a Constitution , at least equally energetic with the one proposed , to the preservation of the Union , is the point at the examination of which we are now arrived . *stop*
This inquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches -- the objects to be provided for by the federal government , the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those objects , the persons upon whom that power ought to operate . *stop*
Its distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention under the succeeding head . *stop*
The principal purposes to be answered by union are these -- the common defense of the members ; the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks ; the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States ; the superintendence of our intercourse , political and commercial , with foreign countries . *stop*
The authorities essential to the common defense are these : to raise armies ; to build and equip fleets ; to prescribe rules for the government of both ; to direct their operations ; to provide for their support . *stop*
These powers ought to exist without limitation , BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE OR DEFINE THE EXTENT AND VARIETY OF NATIONAL EXIGENCIES , OR THE CORRESPONDENT EXTENT AND VARIETY OF THE MEANS WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THEM . *stop*
The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite , and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed . *stop*
This power ought to be coextensive with all the possible combinations of such circumstances ; and ought to be under the direction of the same councils which are appointed to preside over the common defense . *stop*
This is one of those truths which , to a correct and unprejudiced mind , carries its own evidence along with it ; and may be obscured , but can not be made plainer by argument or reasoning . *stop*
It rests upon axioms as simple as they are universal ; the MEANS ought to be proportioned to the END ; the persons , from whose agency the attainment of any END is expected , ought to possess the MEANS by which it is to be attained . *stop*
Whether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with the care of the common defense , is a question in the first instance , open for discussion ; but the moment it is decided in the affirmative , it will follow , that that government ought to be clothed with all the powers requisite to complete execution of its trust . *stop*
And unless it can be shown that the circumstances which may affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate limits ; unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and rationally disputed , it must be admitted , as a necessary consequence , that there can be no limitation of that authority which is to provide for the defense and protection of the community , in any matter essential to its efficacy that is , in any matter essential to the FORMATION , DIRECTION , or SUPPORT of the NATIONAL FORCES . *stop*
Defective as the present Confederation has been proved to be , this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the framers of it ; though they have not made proper or adequate provision for its exercise . *stop*
Congress have an unlimited discretion to make requisitions of men and money ; to govern the army and navy ; to direct their operations . *stop*
As their requisitions are made constitutionally binding upon the States , who are in fact under the most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of them , the intention evidently was that the United States should command whatever resources were by them judged requisite to the '' common defense and general welfare . '' *stop*
It was presumed that a sense of their true interests , and a regard to the dictates of good faith , would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the federal head . *stop*
The experiment has , however , demonstrated that this expectation was ill-founded and illusory ; and the observations , made under the last head , will , I imagine , have sufficed to convince the impartial and discerning , that there is an absolute necessity for an entire change in the first principles of the system ; that if we are in earnest about giving the Union energy and duration , we must abandon the vain project of legislating upon the States in their collective capacities ; we must extend the laws of the federal government to the individual citizens of America ; we must discard the fallacious scheme of quotas and requisitions , as equally impracticable and unjust . *stop*
The result from all this is that the Union ought to be invested with full power to levy troops ; to build and equip fleets ; and to raise the revenues which will be required for the formation and support of an army and navy , in the customary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments . *stop*
If the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a compound instead of a simple , a confederate instead of a sole , government , the essential point which will remain to be adjusted will be to discriminate the OBJECTS , as far as it can be done , which shall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power ; allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the objects committed to its charge . *stop*
Shall the Union be constituted the guardian of the common safety ? *stop*
Are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose ? *stop*
The government of the Union must be empowered to pass all laws , and to make all regulations which have relation to them . *stop*
The same must be the case in respect to commerce , and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to extend . *stop*
Is the administration of justice between the citizens of the same State the proper department of the local governments ? *stop*
These must possess all the authorities which are connected with this object , and with every other that may be allotted to their particular cognizance and direction . *stop*
Not to confer in each case a degree of power commensurate to the end , would be to violate the most obvious rules of prudence and propriety , and improvidently to trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from managing them with vigor and success . *stop*
Who is likely to make suitable provisions for the public defense , as that body to which the guardianship of the public safety is confided ; which , as the centre of information , will best understand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten ; as the representative of the WHOLE , will feel itself most deeply interested in the preservation of every part ; which , from the responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it , will be most sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper exertions ; and which , by the extension of its authority throughout the States , can alone establish uniformity and concert in the plans and measures by which the common safety is to be secured ? *stop*
Is there not a manifest inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the care of the general defense , and leaving in the State governments the EFFECTIVE powers by which it is to be provided for ? *stop*
Is not a want of co-operation the infallible consequence of such a system ? *stop*
And will not weakness , disorder , an undue distribution of the burdens and calamities of war , an unnecessary and intolerable increase of expense , be its natural and inevitable concomitants ? *stop*
Have we not had unequivocal experience of its effects in the course of the revolution which we have just accomplished ? *stop*
Every view we may take of the subject , as candid inquirers after truth , will serve to convince us , that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority , as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management . *stop*
It will indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful attention of the people , to see that it be modeled in such a manner as to admit of its being safely vested with the requisite powers . *stop*
If any plan which has been , or may be , offered to our consideration , should not , upon a dispassionate inspection , be found to answer this description , it ought to be rejected . *stop*
A government , the constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the powers which a free people ought to delegate to any government , would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the NATIONAL INTERESTS . *stop*
Wherever THESE can with propriety be confided , the coincident powers may safely accompany them . *stop*
This is the true result of all just reasoning upon the subject . *stop*
And the adversaries of the plan promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to showing , that the internal structure of the proposed government was such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people . *stop*
They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers . *stop*
The POWERS are not too extensive for the OBJECTS of federal administration , or , in other words , for the management of our NATIONAL INTERESTS ; nor can any satisfactory argument be framed to show that they are chargeable with such an excess . *stop*
If it be true , as has been insinuated by some of the writers on the other side , that the difficulty arises from the nature of the thing , and that the extent of the country will not permit us to form a government in which such ample powers can safely be reposed , it would prove that we ought to contract our views , and resort to the expedient of separate confederacies , which will move within more practicable spheres . *stop*
For the absurdity must continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the most essential national interests , without daring to trust it to the authorities which are indispensable to their proper and efficient management . *stop*
Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions , but firmly embrace a rational alternative . *stop*
I trust , however , that the impracticability of one general system can not be shown . *stop*
I am greatly mistaken , if any thing of weight has yet been advanced of this tendency ; and I flatter myself , that the observations which have been made in the course of these papers have served to place the reverse of that position in as clear a light as any matter still in the womb of time and experience can be susceptible of . *stop*
This , at all events , must be evident , that the very difficulty itself , drawn from the extent of the country , is the strongest argument in favor of an energetic government ; for any other can certainly never preserve the Union of so large an empire . *stop*
If we embrace the tenets of those who oppose the adoption of the proposed Constitution , as the standard of our political creed , we can not fail to verify the gloomy doctrines which predict the impracticability of a national system pervading entire limits of the present Confederacy . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
24 The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , December 19 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : TO THE powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government , in respect to the creation and direction of the national forces , I have met with but one specific objection , which , if I understand it right , is this , that proper provision has not been made against the existence of standing armies in time of peace ; an objection which , I shall now endeavor to show , rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations . *stop*
It has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form , supported only by bold assertions , without the appearance of argument ; without even the sanction of theoretical opinions ; in contradiction to the practice of other free nations , and to the general sense of America , as expressed in most of the existing constitutions . *stop*
The proprietary of this remark will appear , the moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the LEGISLATIVE authority of the nation , in the article of military establishments ; a principle unheard of , except in one or two of our State constitutions , and rejected in all the rest . *stop*
A stranger to our politics , who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture , without having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention , would be naturally led to one of two conclusions : either that it contained a positive injunction , that standing armies should be kept up in time of peace ; or that it vested in the EXECUTIVE the whole power of levying troops , without subjecting his discretion , in any shape , to the control of the legislature . *stop*
If he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself , he would be surprised to discover , that neither the one nor the other was the case ; that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the LEGISLATURE , not in the EXECUTIVE ; that this legislature was to be a popular body , consisting of the representatives of the people periodically elected ; and that instead of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing armies , there was to be found , in respect to this object , an important qualification even of the legislative discretion , in that clause which forbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer period than two years a precaution which , upon a nearer view of it , will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up of troops without evident necessity . *stop*
Disappointed in his first surmise , the person I have supposed would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further . *stop*
He would naturally say to himself , it is impossible that all this vehement and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext . *stop*
It must needs be that this people , so jealous of their liberties , have , in all the preceding models of the constitutions which they have established , inserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this point , the omission of which , in the new plan , has given birth to all this apprehension and clamor . *stop*
If , under this impression , he proceeded to pass in review the several State constitutions , how great would be his disappointment to find that TWO ONLY of them contained an interdiction of standing armies in time of peace ; that the other eleven had either observed a profound silence on the subject , or had in express terms admitted the right of the Legislature to authorize their existence . *stop*
Still , however he would be persuaded that there must be some plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head . *stop*
He would never be able to imagine , while any source of information remained unexplored , that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity , dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive , or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous . *stop*
It would probably occur to him , that he would be likely to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact between the States . *stop*
Here , at length , he would expect to meet with a solution of the enigma . *stop*
No doubt , he would observe to himself , the existing Confederation must contain the most explicit provisions against military establishments in time of peace ; and a departure from this model , in a favorite point , has occasioned the discontent which appears to influence these political champions . *stop*
If he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey of the articles of Confederation , his astonishment would not only be increased , but would acquire a mixture of indignation , at the unexpected discovery , that these articles , instead of containing the prohibition he looked for , and though they had , with jealous circumspection , restricted the authority of the State legislatures in this particular , had not imposed a single restraint on that of the United States . *stop*
If he happened to be a man of quick sensibility , or ardent temper , he could now no longer refrain from regarding these clamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their country ! *stop*
How else , he would say , could the authors of them have been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan , about a point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general sense of America as declared in its different forms of government , and in which it has even superadded a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them ? *stop*
If , on the contrary , he happened to be a man of calm and dispassionate feelings , he would indulge a sigh for the frailty of human nature , and would lament , that in a matter so interesting to the happiness of millions , the true merits of the question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so unfriendly to an impartial and right determination . *stop*
Even such a man could hardly forbear remarking , that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by alarming their passions , rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to their understandings . *stop*
But however little this objection may be countenanced , even by precedents among ourselves , it may be satisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrinsic merits . *stop*
From a close examination it will appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in respect to military establishments in time of peace , would be improper to be imposed , and if imposed , from the necessities of society , would be unlikely to be observed . *stop*
Though a wide ocean separates the United States from Europe , yet there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of confidence or security . *stop*
On one side of us , and stretching far into our rear , are growing settlements subject to the dominion of Britain . *stop*
On the other side , and extending to meet the British settlements , are colonies and establishments subject to the dominion of Spain . *stop*
This situation and the vicinity of the West India Islands , belonging to these two powers create between them , in respect to their American possessions and in relation to us , a common interest . *stop*
The savage tribes on our Western frontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies , their natural allies , because they have most to fear from us , and most to hope from them . *stop*
The improvements in the art of navigation have , as to the facility of communication , rendered distant nations , in a great measure , neighbors . *stop*
Britain and Spain are among the principal maritime powers of Europe . *stop*
A future concert of views between these nations ought not to be regarded as improbable . *stop*
The increasing remoteness of consanguinity is every day diminishing the force of the family compact between France and Spain . *stop*
And politicians have ever with great reason considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of political connection . *stop*
These circumstances combined , admonish us not to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the reach of danger . *stop*
Previous to the Revolution , and ever since the peace , there has been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our Western frontier . *stop*
No person can doubt that these will continue to be indispensable , if it should only be against the ravages and depredations of the Indians . *stop*
These garrisons must either be furnished by occasional detachments from the militia , or by permanent corps in the pay of the government . *stop*
The first is impracticable ; and if practicable , would be pernicious . *stop*
The militia would not long , if at all , submit to be dragged from their occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in times of profound peace . *stop*
And if they could be prevailed upon or compelled to do it , the increased expense of a frequent rotation of service , and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious pursuits of individuals , would form conclusive objections to the scheme . *stop*
It would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as ruinous to private citizens . *stop*
The latter resource of permanent corps in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of peace ; a small one , indeed , but not the less real for being small . *stop*
Here is a simple view of the subject , that shows us at once the impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments , and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and prudence of the legislature . *stop*
In proportion to our increase in strength , it is probable , nay , it may be said certain , that Britain and Spain would augment their military establishments in our neighborhood . *stop*
If we should not be willing to be exposed , in a naked and defenseless condition , to their insults and encroachments , we should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which our Western settlements might be annoyed . *stop*
There are , and will be , particular posts , the possession of which will include the command of large districts of territory , and facilitate future invasions of the remainder . *stop*
It may be added that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the Indian nations . *stop*
Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers ? *stop*
To act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of prudence and policy . *stop*
If we mean to be a commercial people , or even to be secure on our Atlantic side , we must endeavor , as soon as possible , to have a navy . *stop*
To this purpose there must be dock-yards and arsenals ; and for the defense of these , fortifications , and probably garrisons . *stop*
When a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets , this supersedes the necessity of garrisons for that purpose ; but where naval establishments are in their infancy , moderate garrisons will , in all likelihood , be found an indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards , and sometimes of the fleet itself . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
25 The Same Subject Continued ( The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered ) From the New York Packet . *stop*
Friday , December 21 , 1787 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IT MAY perhaps be urged that the objects enumerated in the preceding number ought to be provided for by the State governments , under the direction of the Union . *stop*
But this would be , in reality , an inversion of the primary principle of our political association , as it would in practice transfer the care of the common defense from the federal head to the individual members : a project oppressive to some States , dangerous to all , and baneful to the Confederacy . *stop*
The territories of Britain , Spain , and of the Indian nations in our neighborhood do not border on particular States , but encircle the Union from Maine to Georgia . *stop*
The danger , though in different degrees , is therefore common . *stop*
And the means of guarding against it ought , in like manner , to be the objects of common councils and of a common treasury . *stop*
It happens that some States , from local situation , are more directly exposed . *stop*
New York is of this class . *stop*
Upon the plan of separate provisions , New York would have to sustain the whole weight of the establishments requisite to her immediate safety , and to the mediate or ultimate protection of her neighbors . *stop*
This would neither be equitable as it respected New York nor safe as it respected the other States . *stop*
Various inconveniences would attend such a system . *stop*
The States , to whose lot it might fall to support the necessary establishments , would be as little able as willing , for a considerable time to come , to bear the burden of competent provisions . *stop*
The security of all would thus be subjected to the parsimony , improvidence , or inability of a part . *stop*
If the resources of such part becoming more abundant and extensive , its provisions should be proportionally enlarged , the other States would quickly take the alarm at seeing the whole military force of the Union in the hands of two or three of its members , and those probably amongst the most powerful . *stop*
They would each choose to have some counterpoise , and pretenses could easily be contrived . *stop*
In this situation , military establishments , nourished by mutual jealousy , would be apt to swell beyond their natural or proper size ; and being at the separate disposal of the members , they would be engines for the abridgment or demolition of the national authority . *stop*
Reasons have been already given to induce a supposition that the State governments will too naturally be prone to a rivalship with that of the Union , the foundation of which will be the love of power ; and that in any contest between the federal head and one of its members the people will be most apt to unite with their local government . *stop*
If , in addition to this immense advantage , the ambition of the members should be stimulated by the separate and independent possession of military forces , it would afford too strong a temptation and too great a facility to them to make enterprises upon , and finally to subvert , the constitutional authority of the Union . *stop*
On the other hand , the liberty of the people would be less safe in this state of things than in that which left the national forces in the hands of the national government . *stop*
As far as an army may be considered as a dangerous weapon of power , it had better be in those hands of which the people are most likely to be jealous than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous . *stop*
For it is a truth , which the experience of ages has attested , that the people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the least suspicion . *stop*
The framers of the existing Confederation , fully aware of the danger to the Union from the separate possession of military forces by the States , have , in express terms , prohibited them from having either ships or troops , unless with the consent of Congress . *stop*
The truth is , that the existence of a federal government and military establishments under State authority are not less at variance with each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and the system of quotas and requisitions . *stop*
There are other lights besides those already taken notice of , in which the impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the national legislature will be equally manifest . *stop*
The design of the objection , which has been mentioned , is to preclude standing armies in time of peace , though we have never been informed how far it is designed the prohibition should extend ; whether to raising armies as well as to KEEPING THEM UP in a season of tranquillity or not . *stop*
If it be confined to the latter it will have no precise signification , and it will be ineffectual for the purpose intended . *stop*
When armies are once raised what shall be denominated `` keeping them up , '' contrary to the sense of the Constitution ? *stop*
What time shall be requisite to ascertain the violation ? *stop*
Shall it be a week , a month , a year ? *stop*
Or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues ? *stop*
This would be to admit that they might be kept up IN TIME OF PEACE , against threatening or impending danger , which would be at once to deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition , and to introduce an extensive latitude of construction . *stop*
Who shall judge of the continuance of the danger ? *stop*
This must undoubtedly be submitted to the national government , and the matter would then be brought to this issue , that the national government , to provide against apprehended danger , might in the first instance raise troops , and might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy . *stop*
It is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this would afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision . *stop*
The supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be founded on the supposed probability , or at least possibility , of a combination between the executive and the legislative , in some scheme of usurpation . *stop*
Should this at any time happen , how easy would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger ! *stop*
Indian hostilities , instigated by Spain or Britain , would always be at hand . *stop*
Provocations to produce the desired appearances might even be given to some foreign power , and appeased again by timely concessions . *stop*
If we can reasonably presume such a combination to have been formed , and that the enterprise is warranted by a sufficient prospect of success , the army , when once raised , from whatever cause , or on whatever pretext , may be applied to the execution of the project . *stop*
If , to obviate this consequence , it should be resolved to extend the prohibition to the RAISING of armies in time of peace , the United States would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle which the world has yet seen , that of a nation incapacitated by its Constitution to prepare for defense , before it was actually invaded . *stop*
As the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse , the presence of an enemy within our territories must be waited for , as the legal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the protection of the State . *stop*
We must receive the blow , before we could even prepare to return it . *stop*
All that kind of policy by which nations anticipate distant danger , and meet the gathering storm , must be abstained from , as contrary to the genuine maxims of a free government . *stop*
We must expose our property and liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders , and invite them by our weakness to seize the naked and defenseless prey , because we are afraid that rulers , created by our choice , dependent on our will , might endanger that liberty , by an abuse of the means necessary to its preservation . *stop*
Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its natural bulwark , and would be at all times equal to the national defense . *stop*
This doctrine , in substance , had like to have lost us our independence . *stop*
It cost millions to the United States that might have been saved . *stop*
The facts which , from our own experience , forbid a reliance of this kind , are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a suggestion . *stop*
The steady operations of war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the same kind . *stop*
Considerations of economy , not less than of stability and vigor , confirm this position . *stop*
The American militia , in the course of the late war , have , by their valor on numerous occasions , erected eternal monuments to their fame ; but the bravest of them feel and know that the liberty of their country could not have been established by their efforts alone , however great and valuable they were . *stop*
War , like most other things , is a science to be acquired and perfected by diligence , by perseverance , by time , and by practice . *stop*
All violent policy , as it is contrary to the natural and experienced course of human affairs , defeats itself . *stop*
Pennsylvania , at this instant , affords an example of the truth of this remark . *stop*
The Bill of Rights of that State declares that standing armies are dangerous to liberty , and ought not to be kept up in time of peace . *stop*
Pennsylvania , nevertheless , in a time of profound peace , from the existence of partial disorders in one or two of her counties , has resolved to raise a body of troops ; and in all probability will keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the public peace . *stop*
The conduct of Massachusetts affords a lesson on the same subject , though on different ground . *stop*
That State ( without waiting for the sanction of Congress , as the articles of the Confederation require ) was compelled to raise troops to quell a domestic insurrection , and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a revival of the spirit of revolt . *stop*
The particular constitution of Massachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure ; but the instance is still of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur under our government , as well as under those of other nations , which will sometimes render a military force in time of peace essential to the security of the society , and that it is therefore improper in this respect to control the legislative discretion . *stop*
It also teaches us , in its application to the United States , how little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be respected , even by its own constituents . *stop*
And it teaches us , in addition to the rest , how unequal parchment provisions are to a struggle with public necessity . *stop*
It was a fundamental maxim of the Lacedaemonian commonwealth , that the post of admiral should not be conferred twice on the same person . *stop*
The Peloponnesian confederates , having suffered a severe defeat at sea from the Athenians , demanded Lysander , who had before served with success in that capacity , to command the combined fleets . *stop*
The Lacedaemonians , to gratify their allies , and yet preserve the semblance of an adherence to their ancient institutions , had recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing Lysander with the real power of admiral , under the nominal title of vice-admiral . *stop*
This instance is selected from among a multitude that might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illustrated by domestic examples ; which is , that nations pay little regard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to the necessities of society . *stop*
Wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions that can not be observed , because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws , though dictated by necessity , impairs that sacred reverence which ought to be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a country , and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at all , or is less urgent and palpable . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
26 The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the Common Defense Considered . *stop*
For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , December 22 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IT WAS a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular revolution the minds of men should stop at that happy mean which marks the salutary boundary between POWER and PRIVILEGE , and combines the energy of government with the security of private rights . *stop*
A failure in this delicate and important point is the great source of the inconveniences we experience , and if we are not cautious to avoid a repetition of the error , in our future attempts to rectify and ameliorate our system , we may travel from one chimerical project to another ; we may try change after change ; but we shall never be likely to make any material change for the better . *stop*
The idea of restraining the legislative authority , in the means of providing for the national defense , is one of those refinements which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than enlightened . *stop*
We have seen , however , that it has not had thus far an extensive prevalency ; that even in this country , where it made its first appearance , Pennsylvania and North Carolina are the only two States by which it has been in any degree patronized ; and that all the others have refused to give it the least countenance ; wisely judging that confidence must be placed somewhere ; that the necessity of doing it , is implied in the very act of delegating power ; and that it is better to hazard the abuse of that confidence than to embarrass the government and endanger the public safety by impolitic restrictions on the legislative authority . *stop*
The opponents of the proposed Constitution combat , in this respect , the general decision of America ; and instead of being taught by experience the propriety of correcting any extremes into which we may have heretofore run , they appear disposed to conduct us into others still more dangerous , and more extravagant . *stop*
As if the tone of government had been found too high , or too rigid , the doctrines they teach are calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it , by expedients which , upon other occasions , have been condemned or forborne . *stop*
It may be affirmed without the imputation of invective , that if the principles they inculcate , on various points , could so far obtain as to become the popular creed , they would utterly unfit the people of this country for any species of government whatever . *stop*
But a danger of this kind is not to be apprehended . *stop*
The citizens of America have too much discernment to be argued into anarchy . *stop*
And I am much mistaken , if experience has not wrought a deep and solemn conviction in the public mind , that greater energy of government is essential to the welfare and prosperity of the community . *stop*
It may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin and progress of the idea , which aims at the exclusion of military establishments in time of peace . *stop*
Though in speculative minds it may arise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such institutions , fortified by the events that have happened in other ages and countries , yet as a national sentiment , it must be traced to those habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from whom the inhabitants of these States have in general sprung . *stop*
In England , for a long time after the Norman Conquest , the authority of the monarch was almost unlimited . *stop*
Inroads were gradually made upon the prerogative , in favor of liberty , first by the barons , and afterwards by the people , till the greatest part of its most formidable pretensions became extinct . *stop*
But it was not till the revolution in 1688 , which elevated the Prince of Orange to the throne of Great Britain , that English liberty was completely triumphant . *stop*
As incident to the undefined power of making war , an acknowledged prerogative of the crown , Charles II . *stop*
had , by his own authority , kept on foot in time of peace a body of 5,000 regular troops . *stop*
And this number James II . *stop*
increased to 30,000 ; who were paid out of his civil list . *stop*
At the revolution , to abolish the exercise of so dangerous an authority , it became an article of the Bill of Rights then framed , that `` the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace , UNLESS WITH THE CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT , was against law . '' *stop*
In that kingdom , when the pulse of liberty was at its highest pitch , no security against the danger of standing armies was thought requisite , beyond a prohibition of their being raised or kept up by the mere authority of the executive magistrate . *stop*
The patriots , who effected that memorable revolution , were too temperate , too wellinformed , to think of any restraint on the legislative discretion . *stop*
They were aware that a certain number of troops for guards and garrisons were indispensable ; that no precise bounds could be set to the national exigencies ; that a power equal to every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the government : and that when they referred the exercise of that power to the judgment of the legislature , they had arrived at the ultimate point of precaution which was reconcilable with the safety of the community . *stop*
From the same source , the people of America may be said to have derived an hereditary impression of danger to liberty , from standing armies in time of peace . *stop*
The circumstances of a revolution quickened the public sensibility on every point connected with the security of popular rights , and in some instances raise the warmth of our zeal beyond the degree which consisted with the due temperature of the body politic . *stop*
The attempts of two of the States to restrict the authority of the legislature in the article of military establishments , are of the number of these instances . *stop*
The principles which had taught us to be jealous of the power of an hereditary monarch were by an injudicious excess extended to the representatives of the people in their popular assemblies . *stop*
Even in some of the States , where this error was not adopted , we find unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought not to be kept up , in time of peace , WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LEGISLATURE . *stop*
I call them unnecessary , because the reason which had introduced a similar provision into the English Bill of Rights is not applicable to any of the State constitutions . *stop*
The power of raising armies at all , under those constitutions , can by no construction be deemed to reside anywhere else , than in the legislatures themselves ; and it was superfluous , if not absurd , to declare that a matter should not be done without the consent of a body , which alone had the power of doing it . *stop*
Accordingly , in some of these constitutions , and among others , in that of this State of New York , which has been justly celebrated , both in Europe and America , as one of the best of the forms of government established in this country , there is a total silence upon the subject . *stop*
It is remarkable , that even in the two States which seem to have meditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of peace , the mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than prohibitory . *stop*
It is not said , that standing armies SHALL NOT BE kept up , but that they OUGHT NOT to be kept up , in time of peace . *stop*
This ambiguity of terms appears to have been the result of a conflict between jealousy and conviction ; between the desire of excluding such establishments at all events , and the persuasion that an absolute exclusion would be unwise and unsafe . *stop*
Can it be doubted that such a provision , whenever the situation of public affairs was understood to require a departure from it , would be interpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition , and would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of the State ? *stop*
Let the fact already mentioned , with respect to Pennsylvania , decide . *stop*
What then ( it may be asked ) is the use of such a provision , if it cease to operate the moment there is an inclination to disregard it ? *stop*
Let us examine whether there be any comparison , in point of efficacy , between the provision alluded to and that which is contained in the new Constitution , for restraining the appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two years . *stop*
The former , by aiming at too much , is calculated to effect nothing ; the latter , by steering clear of an imprudent extreme , and by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the exigencies of the nation , will have a salutary and powerful operation . *stop*
The legislature of the United States will be OBLIGED , by this provision , once at least in every two years , to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot ; to come to a new resolution on the point ; and to declare their sense of the matter , by a formal vote in the face of their constituents . *stop*
They are not AT LIBERTY to vest in the executive department permanent funds for the support of an army , if they were even incautious enough to be willing to repose in it so improper a confidence . *stop*
As the spirit of party , in different degrees , must be expected to infect all political bodies , there will be , no doubt , persons in the national legislature willing enough to arraign the measures and criminate the views of the majority . *stop*
The provision for the support of a military force will always be a favorable topic for declamation . *stop*
As often as the question comes forward , the public attention will be roused and attracted to the subject , by the party in opposition ; and if the majority should be really disposed to exceed the proper limits , the community will be warned of the danger , and will have an opportunity of taking measures to guard against it . *stop*
Independent of parties in the national legislature itself , as often as the period of discussion arrived , the State legislatures , who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government , will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers , and will be ready enough , if any thing improper appears , to sound the alarm to the people , and not only to be the VOICE , but , if necessary , the ARM of their discontent . *stop*
Schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community REQUIRE TIME to mature them for execution . *stop*
An army , so large as seriously to menace those liberties , could only be formed by progressive augmentations ; which would suppose , not merely a temporary combination between the legislature and executive , but a continued conspiracy for a series of time . *stop*
Is it probable that such a combination would exist at all ? *stop*
Is it probable that it would be persevered in , and transmitted along through all the successive variations in a representative body , which biennial elections would naturally produce in both houses ? *stop*
Is it presumable , that every man , the instant he took his seat in the national Senate or House of Representatives , would commence a traitor to his constituents and to his country ? *stop*
Can it be supposed that there would not be found one man , discerning enough to detect so atrocious a conspiracy , or bold or honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger ? *stop*
If such presumptions can fairly be made , there ought at once to be an end of all delegated authority . *stop*
The people should resolve to recall all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own hands , and to divide themselves into as many States as there are counties , in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in person . *stop*
If such suppositions could even be reasonably made , still the concealment of the design , for any duration , would be impracticable . *stop*
It would be announced , by the very circumstance of augmenting the army to so great an extent in time of profound peace . *stop*
What colorable reason could be assigned , in a country so situated , for such vast augmentations of the military force ? *stop*
It is impossible that the people could be long deceived ; and the destruction of the project , and of the projectors , would quickly follow the discovery . *stop*
It has been said that the provision which limits the appropriation of money for the support of an army to the period of two years would be unavailing , because the Executive , when once possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission , would find resources in that very force sufficient to enable him to dispense with supplies from the acts of the legislature . *stop*
But the question again recurs , upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace ? *stop*
If we suppose it to have been created in consequence of some domestic insurrection or foreign war , then it becomes a case not within the principles of the objection ; for this is levelled against the power of keeping up troops in time of peace . *stop*
Few persons will be so visionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion ; and if the defense of the community under such circumstances should make it necessary to have an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty , this is one of those calamities for which there is neither preventative nor cure . *stop*
It can not be provided against by any possible form of government ; it might even result from a simple league offensive and defensive , if it should ever be necessary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common defense . *stop*
But it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a united than in a disunited state ; nay , it may be safely asserted that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter situation . *stop*
It is not easy to conceive a possibility that dangers so formidable can assail the whole Union , as to demand a force considerable enough to place our liberties in the least jeopardy , especially if we take into our view the aid to be derived from the militia , which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and powerful auxiliary . *stop*
But in a state of disunion ( as has been fully shown in another place ) , the contrary of this supposition would become not only probable , but almost unavoidable . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
27 The Same Subject Continued ( The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the Common Defense Considered ) From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , December 25 , 1787 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IT HAS been urged , in different shapes , that a Constitution of the kind proposed by the convention can not operate without the aid of a military force to execute its laws . *stop*
This , however , like most other things that have been alleged on that side , rests on mere general assertion , unsupported by any precise or intelligible designation of the reasons upon which it is founded . *stop*
As far as I have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors , it seems to originate in a presupposition that the people will be disinclined to the exercise of federal authority in any matter of an internal nature . *stop*
Waiving any exception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and external , let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that disinclination in the people . *stop*
Unless we presume at the same time that the powers of the general government will be worse administered than those of the State government , there seems to be no room for the presumption of ill-will , disaffection , or opposition in the people . *stop*
I believe it may be laid down as a general rule that their confidence in and obedience to a government will commonly be proportioned to the goodness or badness of its administration . *stop*
It must be admitted that there are exceptions to this rule ; but these exceptions depend so entirely on accidental causes , that they can not be considered as having any relation to the intrinsic merits or demerits of a constitution . *stop*
These can only be judged of by general principles and maxims . *stop*
Various reasons have been suggested , in the course of these papers , to induce a probability that the general government will be better administered than the particular governments ; the principal of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election will present a greater option , or latitude of choice , to the people ; that through the medium of the State legislatures which are select bodies of men , and which are to appoint the members of the national Senate there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be composed with peculiar care and judgment ; that these circumstances promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the national councils , and that they will be less apt to be tainted by the spirit of faction , and more out of the reach of those occasional ill-humors , or temporary prejudices and propensities , which , in smaller societies , frequently contaminate the public councils , beget injustice and oppression of a part of the community , and engender schemes which , though they gratify a momentary inclination or desire , terminate in general distress , dissatisfaction , and disgust . *stop*
Several additional reasons of considerable force , to fortify that probability , will occur when we come to survey , with a more critical eye , the interior structure of the edifice which we are invited to erect . *stop*
It will be sufficient here to remark , that until satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an opinion , that the federal government is likely to be administered in such a manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the people , there can be no reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws of the Union will meet with any greater obstruction from them , or will stand in need of any other methods to enforce their execution , than the laws of the particular members . *stop*
The hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition ; the dread of punishment , a proportionably strong discouragement to it . *stop*
Will not the government of the Union , which , if possessed of a due degree of power , can call to its aid the collective resources of the whole Confederacy , be more likely to repress the FORMER sentiment and to inspire the LATTER , than that of a single State , which can only command the resources within itself ? *stop*
A turbulent faction in a State may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to the government in that State ; but it can hardly be so infatuated as to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts of the Union . *stop*
If this reflection be just , there is less danger of resistance from irregular combinations of individuals to the authority of the Confederacy than to that of a single member . *stop*
I will , in this place , hazard an observation , which will not be the less just because to some it may appear new ; which is , that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exercise of government , the more the citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life , the more it is familiarized to their sight and to their feelings , the further it enters into those objects which touch the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs of the human heart , the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the respect and attachment of the community . *stop*
Man is very much a creature of habit . *stop*
A thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence upon his mind . *stop*
A government continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be expected to interest the sensations of the people . *stop*
The inference is , that the authority of the Union , and the affections of the citizens towards it , will be strengthened , rather than weakened , by its extension to what are called matters of internal concern ; and will have less occasion to recur to force , in proportion to the familiarity and comprehensiveness of its agency . *stop*
The more it circulates through those channels and currents in which the passions of mankind naturally flow , the less will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compulsion . *stop*
One thing , at all events , must be evident , that a government like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity of using force , than that species of league contend for by most of its opponents ; the authority of which should only operate upon the States in their political or collective capacities . *stop*
It has been shown that in such a Confederacy there can be no sanction for the laws but force ; that frequent delinquencies in the members are the natural offspring of the very frame of the government ; and that as often as these happen , they can only be redressed , if at all , by war and violence . *stop*
The plan reported by the convention , by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several States , will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of each , in the execution of its laws . *stop*
It is easy to perceive that this will tend to destroy , in the common apprehension , all distinction between the sources from which they might proceed ; and will give the federal government the same advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority which is enjoyed by the government of each State , in addition to the influence on public opinion which will result from the important consideration of its having power to call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole Union . *stop*
It merits particular attention in this place , that the laws of the Confederacy , as to the ENUMERATED and LEGITIMATE objects of its jurisdiction , will become the SUPREME LAW of the land ; to the observance of which all officers , legislative , executive , and judicial , in each State , will be bound by the sanctity of an oath . *stop*
Thus the legislatures , courts , and magistrates , of the respective members , will be incorporated into the operations of the national government AS FAR AS ITS JUST AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY EXTENDS ; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws . *stop*
Any man who will pursue , by his own reflections , the consequences of this situation , will perceive that there is good ground to calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the Union , if its powers are administered with a common share of prudence . *stop*
If we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary , we may deduce any inferences we please from the supposition ; for it is certainly possible , by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of the best government that ever was , or ever can be instituted , to provoke and precipitate the people into the wildest excesses . *stop*
But though the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should presume that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of public good , or to the obligations of duty , I would still ask them how the interests of ambition , or the views of encroachment , can be promoted by such a conduct ? *stop*

28 The Same Subject Continued ( The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the Common Defense Considered ) For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , December 26 , 1787 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THAT there may happen cases in which the national government may be necessitated to resort to force , can not be denied . *stop*
Our own experience has corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of other nations ; that emergencies of this sort will sometimes arise in all societies , however constituted ; that seditions and insurrections are , unhappily , maladies as inseparable from the body politic as tumors and eruptions from the natural body ; that the idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law ( which we have been told is the only admissible principle of republican government ) , has no place but in the reveries of those political doctors whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of experimental instruction . *stop*
Should such emergencies at any time happen under the national government , there could be no remedy but force . *stop*
The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief . *stop*
If it should be a slight commotion in a small part of a State , the militia of the residue would be adequate to its suppression ; and the national presumption is that they would be ready to do their duty . *stop*
An insurrection , whatever may be its immediate cause , eventually endangers all government . *stop*
Regard to the public peace , if not to the rights of the Union , would engage the citizens to whom the contagion had not communicated itself to oppose the insurgents ; and if the general government should be found in practice conducive to the prosperity and felicity of the people , it were irrational to believe that they would be disinclined to its support . *stop*
If , on the contrary , the insurrection should pervade a whole State , or a principal part of it , the employment of a different kind of force might become unavoidable . *stop*
It appears that Massachusetts found it necessary to raise troops for repressing the disorders within that State ; that Pennsylvania , from the mere apprehension of commotions among a part of her citizens , has thought proper to have recourse to the same measure . *stop*
Suppose the State of New York had been inclined to re-establish her lost jurisdiction over the inhabitants of Vermont , could she have hoped for success in such an enterprise from the efforts of the militia alone ? *stop*
Would she not have been compelled to raise and to maintain a more regular force for the execution of her design ? *stop*
If it must then be admitted that the necessity of recurring to a force different from the militia , in cases of this extraordinary nature , is applicable to the State governments themselves , why should the possibility , that the national government might be under a like necessity , in similar extremities , be made an objection to its existence ? *stop*
Is it not surprising that men who declare an attachment to the Union in the abstract , should urge as an objection to the proposed Constitution what applies with tenfold weight to the plan for which they contend ; and what , as far as it has any foundation in truth , is an inevitable consequence of civil society upon an enlarged scale ? *stop*
Who would not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty republics ? *stop*
Let us pursue this examination in another light . *stop*
Suppose , in lieu of one general system , two , or three , or even four Confederacies were to be formed , would not the same difficulty oppose itself to the operations of either of these Confederacies ? *stop*
Would not each of them be exposed to the same casualties ; and when these happened , be obliged to have recourse to the same expedients for upholding its authority which are objected to in a government for all the States ? *stop*
Would the militia , in this supposition , be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union ? *stop*
All candid and intelligent men must , upon due consideration , acknowledge that the principle of the objection is equally applicable to either of the two cases ; and that whether we have one government for all the States , or different governments for different parcels of them , or even if there should be an entire separation of the States , there might sometimes be a necessity to make use of a force constituted differently from the militia , to preserve the peace of the community and to maintain the just authority of the laws against those violent invasions of them which amount to insurrections and rebellions . *stop*
Independent of all other reasonings upon the subject , it is a full answer to those who require a more peremptory provision against military establishments in time of peace , to say that the whole power of the proposed government is to be in the hands of the representatives of the people . *stop*
This is the essential , and , after all , only efficacious security for the rights and privileges of the people , which is attainable in civil society . *stop*
If the representatives of the people betray their constituents , there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government , and which against the usurpations of the national rulers , may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state . *stop*
In a single state , if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers , the different parcels , subdivisions , or districts of which it consists , having no distinct government in each , can take no regular measures for defense . *stop*
The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms , without concert , without system , without resource ; except in their courage and despair . *stop*
The usurpers , clothed with the forms of legal authority , can too often crush the opposition in embryo . *stop*
The smaller the extent of the territory , the more difficult will it be for the people to form a regular or systematic plan of opposition , and the more easy will it be to defeat their early efforts . *stop*
Intelligence can be more speedily obtained of their preparations and movements , and the military force in the possession of the usurpers can be more rapidly directed against the part where the opposition has begun . *stop*
In this situation there must be a peculiar coincidence of circumstances to insure success to the popular resistance . *stop*
The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state , provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them . *stop*
The natural strength of the people in a large community , in proportion to the artificial strength of the government , is greater than in a small , and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny . *stop*
But in a confederacy the people , without exaggeration , may be said to be entirely the masters of their own fate . *stop*
Power being almost always the rival of power , the general government will at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of the state governments , and these will have the same disposition towards the general government . *stop*
The people , by throwing themselves into either scale , will infallibly make it preponderate . *stop*
If their rights are invaded by either , they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress . *stop*
How wise will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves an advantage which can never be too highly prized ! *stop*
It may safely be received as an axiom in our political system , that the State governments will , in all possible contingencies , afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority . *stop*
Projects of usurpation can not be masked under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men , as of the people at large . *stop*
The legislatures will have better means of information . *stop*
They can discover the danger at a distance ; and possessing all the organs of civil power , and the confidence of the people , they can at once adopt a regular plan of opposition , in which they can combine all the resources of the community . *stop*
They can readily communicate with each other in the different States , and unite their common forces for the protection of their common liberty . *stop*
The great extent of the country is a further security . *stop*
We have already experienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign power . *stop*
And it would have precisely the same effect against the enterprises of ambitious rulers in the national councils . *stop*
If the federal army should be able to quell the resistance of one State , the distant States would have it in their power to make head with fresh forces . *stop*
The advantages obtained in one place must be abandoned to subdue the opposition in others ; and the moment the part which had been reduced to submission was left to itself , its efforts would be renewed , and its resistance revive . *stop*
We should recollect that the extent of the military force must , at all events , be regulated by the resources of the country . *stop*
For a long time to come , it will not be possible to maintain a large army ; and as the means of doing this increase , the population and natural strength of the community will proportionably increase . *stop*
When will the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the people of an immense empire , who are in a situation , through the medium of their State governments , to take measures for their own defense , with all the celerity , regularity , and system of independent nations ? *stop*
The apprehension may be considered as a disease , for which there can be found no cure in the resources of argument and reasoning . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
29 Concerning the Militia From the New York Packet . *stop*
Wednesday , January 9 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE power of regulating the militia , and of commanding its services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties of superintending the common defense , and of watching over the internal peace of the Confederacy . *stop*
It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects , whenever they were called into service for the public defense . *stop*
It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army ; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness . *stop*
This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority . *stop*
It is , therefore , with the most evident propriety , that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union `` to provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS , AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS . '' *stop*
Of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to the plan of the convention , there is none that was so little to have been expected , or is so untenable in itself , as the one from which this particular provision has been attacked . *stop*
If a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country , it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security . *stop*
If standing armies are dangerous to liberty , an efficacious power over the militia , in the body to whose care the protection of the State is committed , ought , as far as possible , to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions . *stop*
If the federal government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate , it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind of force . *stop*
If it can not avail itself of the former , it will be obliged to recur to the latter . *stop*
To render an army unnecessary , will be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper . *stop*
In order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union , it has been remarked that there is nowhere any provision in the proposed Constitution for calling out the POSSE COMITATUS , to assist the magistrate in the execution of his duty , whence it has been inferred , that military force was intended to be his only auxiliary . *stop*
There is a striking incoherence in the objections which have appeared , and sometimes even from the same quarter , not much calculated to inspire a very favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors . *stop*
The same persons who tell us in one breath , that the powers of the federal government will be despotic and unlimited , inform us in the next , that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS . *stop*
The latter , fortunately , is as much short of the truth as the former exceeds it . *stop*
It would be as absurd to doubt , that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute its declared powers , would include that of requiring the assistance of the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution of those laws , as it would be to believe , that a right to enact laws necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of landed property , or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating to it . *stop*
It being therefore evident that the supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely destitute of color , it will follow , that the conclusion which has been drawn from it , in its application to the authority of the federal government over the militia , is as uncandid as it is illogical . *stop*
What reason could there be to infer , that force was intended to be the sole instrument of authority , merely because there is a power to make use of it when necessary ? *stop*
What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in this manner ? *stop*
How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and conviction ? *stop*
By a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy , we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself , in the hands of the federal government . *stop*
It is observed that select corps may be formed , composed of the young and ardent , who may be rendered subservient to the views of arbitrary power . *stop*
What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government , is impossible to be foreseen . *stop*
But so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps as dangerous , were the Constitution ratified , and were I to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this State on the subject of a militia establishment , I should hold to him , in substance , the following discourse : '' The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious , if it were capable of being carried into execution . *stop*
A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice . *stop*
It is not a day , or even a week , that will suffice for the attainment of it . *stop*
To oblige the great body of the yeomanry , and of the other classes of the citizens , to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions , as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia , would be a real grievance to the people , and a serious public inconvenience and loss . *stop*
It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country , to an amount which , calculating upon the present numbers of the people , would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the States . *stop*
To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent , would be unwise : and the experiment , if made , could not succeed , because it would not long be endured . *stop*
Little more can reasonably be aimed at , with respect to the people at large , than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected , it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year . *stop*
`` But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable ; yet it is a matter of the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should , as soon as possible , be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia . *stop*
The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent , upon such principles as will really fit them for service in case of need . *stop*
By thus circumscribing the plan , it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia , ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require it . *stop*
This will not only lessen the call for military establishments , but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens , little , if at all , inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms , who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens . *stop*
This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army , and the best possible security against it , if it should exist . '' *stop*
Thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should I reason on the same subject , deducing arguments of safety from the very sources which they represent as fraught with danger and perdition . *stop*
But how the national legislature may reason on the point , is a thing which neither they nor I can foresee . *stop*
There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of danger to liberty from the militia , that one is at a loss whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery ; whether to consider it as a mere trial of skill , like the paradoxes of rhetoricians ; as a disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price ; or as the serious offspring of political fanaticism . *stop*
Where in the name of common-sense , are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons , our brothers , our neighbors , our fellow-citizens ? *stop*
What shadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings , sentiments , habits and interests ? *stop*
What reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe regulations for the militia , and to command its services when necessary , while the particular States are to have the SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS ? *stop*
If it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal government , the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to extinguish it . *stop*
There can be no doubt that this circumstance will always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia . *stop*
In reading many of the publications against the Constitution , a man is apt to imagine that he is perusing some ill-written tale or romance , which instead of natural and agreeable images , exhibits to the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes -- `` Gorgons , hydras , and chimeras dire '' ; discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents , and transforming everything it touches into a monster . *stop*
A sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and improbable suggestions which have taken place respecting the power of calling for the services of the militia . *stop*
That of New Hampshire is to be marched to Georgia , of Georgia to New Hampshire , of New York to Kentucky , and of Kentucky to Lake Champlain . *stop*
Nay , the debts due to the French and Dutch are to be paid in militiamen instead of louis d'ors and ducats . *stop*
At one moment there is to be a large army to lay prostrate the liberties of the people ; at another moment the militia of Virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six hundred miles , to tame the republican contumacy of Massachusetts ; and that of Massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to subdue the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic Virginians . *stop*
Do the persons who rave at this rate imagine that their art or their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the people of America for infallible truths ? *stop*
If there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of despotism , what need of the militia ? *stop*
If there should be no army , whither would the militia , irritated by being called upon to undertake a distant and hopeless expedition , for the purpose of riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen , direct their course , but to the seat of the tyrants , who had meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project , to crush them in their imagined intrenchments of power , and to make them an example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people ? *stop*
Is this the way in which usurpers stride to dominion over a numerous and enlightened nation ? *stop*
Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations ? *stop*
Do they usually commence their career by wanton and disgustful acts of power , calculated to answer no end , but to draw upon themselves universal hatred and execration ? *stop*
Are suppositions of this sort the sober admonitions of discerning patriots to a discerning people ? *stop*
Or are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or distempered enthusiasts ? *stop*
If we were even to suppose the national rulers actuated by the most ungovernable ambition , it is impossible to believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish their designs . *stop*
In times of insurrection , or invasion , it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighboring State should be marched into another , to resist a common enemy , or to guard the republic against the violence of faction or sedition . *stop*
This was frequently the case , in respect to the first object , in the course of the late war ; and this mutual succor is , indeed , a principal end of our political association . *stop*
If the power of affording it be placed under the direction of the Union , there will be no danger of a supine and listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor , till its near approach had superadded the incitements of self-preservation to the too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
30 Concerning the General Power of Taxation From the New York Packet . *stop*
Friday , December 28 , 1787 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IT HAS been already observed that the federal government ought to possess the power of providing for the support of the national forces ; in which proposition was intended to be included the expense of raising troops , of building and equipping fleets , and all other expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and operations . *stop*
But these are not the only objects to which the jurisdiction of the Union , in respect to revenue , must necessarily be empowered to extend . *stop*
It must embrace a provision for the support of the national civil list ; for the payment of the national debts contracted , or that may be contracted ; and , in general , for all those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national treasury . *stop*
The conclusion is , that there must be interwoven , in the frame of the government , a general power of taxation , in one shape or another . *stop*
Money is , with propriety , considered as the vital principle of the body politic ; as that which sustains its life and motion , and enables it to perform its most essential functions . *stop*
A complete power , therefore , to procure a regular and adequate supply of it , as far as the resources of the community will permit , may be regarded as an indispensable ingredient in every constitution . *stop*
From a deficiency in this particular , one of two evils must ensue ; either the people must be subjected to continual plunder , as a substitute for a more eligible mode of supplying the public wants , or the government must sink into a fatal atrophy , and , in a short course of time , perish . *stop*
In the Ottoman or Turkish empire , the sovereign , though in other respects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects , has no right to impose a new tax . *stop*
The consequence is that he permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people without mercy ; and , in turn , squeezes out of them the sums of which he stands in need , to satisfy his own exigencies and those of the state . *stop*
In America , from a like cause , the government of the Union has gradually dwindled into a state of decay , approaching nearly to annihilation . *stop*
Who can doubt , that the happiness of the people in both countries would be promoted by competent authorities in the proper hands , to provide the revenues which the necessities of the public might require ? *stop*
The present Confederation , feeble as it is intended to repose in the United States , an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary wants of the Union . *stop*
But proceeding upon an erroneous principle , it has been done in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the intention . *stop*
Congress , by the articles which compose that compact ( as has already been stated ) , are authorized to ascertain and call for any sums of money necessary , in their judgment , to the service of the United States ; and their requisitions , if conformable to the rule of apportionment , are in every constitutional sense obligatory upon the States . *stop*
These have no right to question the propriety of the demand ; no discretion beyond that of devising the ways and means of furnishing the sums demanded . *stop*
But though this be strictly and truly the case ; though the assumption of such a right would be an infringement of the articles of Union ; though it may seldom or never have been avowedly claimed , yet in practice it has been constantly exercised , and would continue to be so , as long as the revenues of the Confederacy should remain dependent on the intermediate agency of its members . *stop*
What the consequences of this system have been , is within the knowledge of every man the least conversant in our public affairs , and has been amply unfolded in different parts of these inquiries . *stop*
It is this which has chiefly contributed to reduce us to a situation , which affords ample cause both of mortification to ourselves , and of triumph to our enemies . *stop*
What remedy can there be for this situation , but in a change of the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions ? *stop*
What substitute can there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance , but that of permitting the national government to raise its own revenues by the ordinary methods of taxation authorized in every well-ordered constitution of civil government ? *stop*
Ingenious men may declaim with plausibility on any subject ; but no human ingenuity can point out any other expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and embarrassments naturally resulting from defective supplies of the public treasury . *stop*
The more intelligent adversaries of the new Constitution admit the force of this reasoning ; but they qualify their admission by a distinction between what they call INTERNAL and EXTERNAL taxation . *stop*
The former they would reserve to the State governments ; the latter , which they explain into commercial imposts , or rather duties on imported articles , they declare themselves willing to concede to the federal head . *stop*
This distinction , however , would violate the maxim of good sense and sound policy , which dictates that every POWER ought to be in proportion to its OBJECT ; and would still leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the State governments , inconsistent with every idea of vigor or efficiency . *stop*
Who can pretend that commercial imposts are , or would be , alone equal to the present and future exigencies of the Union ? *stop*
Taking into the account the existing debt , foreign and domestic , upon any plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed with the importance of public justice and public credit could approve , in addition to the establishments which all parties will acknowledge to be necessary , we could not reasonably flatter ourselves , that this resource alone , upon the most improved scale , would even suffice for its present necessities . *stop*
Its future necessities admit not of calculation or limitation ; and upon the principle , more than once adverted to , the power of making provision for them as they arise ought to be equally unconfined . *stop*
I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history of mankind , that , IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS , THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION , IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE , WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES . *stop*
To say that deficiencies may be provided for by requisitions upon the States , is on the one hand to acknowledge that this system can not be depended upon , and on the other hand to depend upon it for every thing beyond a certain limit . *stop*
Those who have carefully attended to its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by experience or delineated in the course of these papers , must feel invincible repugnancy to trusting the national interests in any degree to its operation . *stop*
Its inevitable tendency , whenever it is brought into activity , must be to enfeeble the Union , and sow the seeds of discord and contention between the federal head and its members , and between the members themselves . *stop*
Can it be expected that the deficiencies would be better supplied in this mode than the total wants of the Union have heretofore been supplied in the same mode ? *stop*
It ought to be recollected that if less will be required from the States , they will have proportionably less means to answer the demand . *stop*
If the opinions of those who contend for the distinction which has been mentioned were to be received as evidence of truth , one would be led to conclude that there was some known point in the economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and to say : Thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by supplying the wants of government , and all beyond this is unworthy of our care or anxiety . *stop*
How is it possible that a government half supplied and always necessitous , can fulfill the purposes of its institution , can provide for the security , advance the prosperity , or support the reputation of the commonwealth ? *stop*
How can it ever possess either energy or stability , dignity or credit , confidence at home or respectability abroad ? *stop*
How can its administration be any thing else than a succession of expedients temporizing , impotent , disgraceful ? *stop*
How will it be able to avoid a frequent sacrifice of its engagements to immediate necessity ? *stop*
How can it undertake or execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good ? *stop*
Let us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in the very first war in which we should happen to be engaged . *stop*
We will presume , for argument 's sake , that the revenue arising from the impost duties answers the purposes of a provision for the public debt and of a peace establishment for the Union . *stop*
Thus circumstanced , a war breaks out . *stop*
What would be the probable conduct of the government in such an emergency ? *stop*
Taught by experience that proper dependence could not be placed on the success of requisitions , unable by its own authority to lay hold of fresh resources , and urged by considerations of national danger , would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to the defense of the State ? *stop*
It is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be avoided ; and if it should be taken , it is evident that it would prove the destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming essential to the public safety . *stop*
To imagine that at such a crisis credit might be dispensed with , would be the extreme of infatuation . *stop*
In the modern system of war , nations the most wealthy are obliged to have recourse to large loans . *stop*
A country so little opulent as ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree . *stop*
But who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its measures for paying ? *stop*
The loans it might be able to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in their conditions . *stop*
They would be made upon the same principles that usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors , with a sparing hand and at enormous premiums . *stop*
It may perhaps be imagined that , from the scantiness of the resources of the country , the necessity of diverting the established funds in the case supposed would exist , though the national government should possess an unrestrained power of taxation . *stop*
But two considerations will serve to quiet all apprehension on this head : one is , that we are sure the resources of the community , in their full extent , will be brought into activity for the benefit of the Union ; the other is , that whatever deficiences there may be , can without difficulty be supplied by loans . *stop*
The power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation , by its own authority , would enable the national government to borrow as far as its necessities might require . *stop*
Foreigners , as well as the citizens of America , could then reasonably repose confidence in its engagements ; but to depend upon a government that must itself depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling its contracts , when once its situation is clearly understood , would require a degree of credulity not often to be met with in the pecuniary transactions of mankind , and little reconcilable with the usual sharp-sightedness of avarice . *stop*
Reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who hope to see realized in America the halcyon scenes of the poetic or fabulous age ; but to those who believe we are likely to experience a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have fallen to the lot of other nations , they must appear entitled to serious attention . *stop*
Such men must behold the actual situation of their country with painful solicitude , and deprecate the evils which ambition or revenge might , with too much facility , inflict upon it . *stop*

31 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , January 1 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IN DISQUISITIONS of every kind , there are certain primary truths , or first principles , upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend . *stop*
These contain an internal evidence which , antecedent to all reflection or combination , commands the assent of the mind . *stop*
Where it produces not this effect , it must proceed either from some defect or disorder in the organs of perception , or from the influence of some strong interest , or passion , or prejudice . *stop*
Of this nature are the maxims in geometry , that '' the whole is greater than its part ; things equal to the same are equal to one another ; two straight lines can not enclose a space ; and all right angles are equal to each other . '' *stop*
Of the same nature are these other maxims in ethics and politics , that there can not be an effect without a cause ; that the means ought to be proportioned to the end ; that every power ought to be commensurate with its object ; that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation . *stop*
And there are other truths in the two latter sciences which , if they can not pretend to rank in the class of axioms , are yet such direct inferences from them , and so obvious in themselves , and so agreeable to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of common-sense , that they challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind , with a degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible . *stop*
The objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely abstracted from those pursuits which stir up and put in motion the unruly passions of the human heart , that mankind , without difficulty , adopt not only the more simple theorems of the science , but even those abstruse paradoxes which , however they may appear susceptible of demonstration , are at variance with the natural conceptions which the mind , without the aid of philosophy , would be led to entertain upon the subject . *stop*
The INFINITE DIVISIBILITY of matter , or , in other words , the INFINITE divisibility of a FINITE thing , extending even to the minutest atom , is a point agreed among geometricians , though not less incomprehensible to common-sense than any of those mysteries in religion , against which the batteries of infidelity have been so industriously leveled . *stop*
But in the sciences of morals and politics , men are found far less tractable . *stop*
To a certain degree , it is right and useful that this should be the case . *stop*
Caution and investigation are a necessary armor against error and imposition . *stop*
But this untractableness may be carried too far , and may degenerate into obstinacy , perverseness , or disingenuity . *stop*
Though it can not be pretended that the principles of moral and political knowledge have , in general , the same degree of certainty with those of the mathematics , yet they have much better claims in this respect than , to judge from the conduct of men in particular situations , we should be disposed to allow them . *stop*
The obscurity is much oftener in the passions and prejudices of the reasoner than in the subject . *stop*
Men , upon too many occasions , do not give their own understandings fair play ; but , yielding to some untoward bias , they entangle themselves in words and confound themselves in subtleties . *stop*
How else could it happen ( if we admit the objectors to be sincere in their opposition ) , that positions so clear as those which manifest the necessity of a general power of taxation in the government of the Union , should have to encounter any adversaries among men of discernment ? *stop*
Though these positions have been elsewhere fully stated , they will perhaps not be improperly recapitulated in this place , as introductory to an examination of what may have been offered by way of objection to them . *stop*
They are in substance as follows : A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care , and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible , free from every other control but a regard to the public good and to the sense of the people . *stop*
As the duties of superintending the national defense and of securing the public peace against foreign or domestic violence involve a provision for casualties and dangers to which no possible limits can be assigned , the power of making that provision ought to know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the resources of the community . *stop*
As revenue is the essential engine by which the means of answering the national exigencies must be procured , the power of procuring that article in its full extent must necessarily be comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies . *stop*
As theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of procuring revenue is unavailing when exercised over the States in their collective capacities , the federal government must of necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the ordinary modes . *stop*
Did not experience evince the contrary , it would be natural to conclude that the propriety of a general power of taxation in the national government might safely be permitted to rest on the evidence of these propositions , unassisted by any additional arguments or illustrations . *stop*
But we find , in fact , that the antagonists of the proposed Constitution , so far from acquiescing in their justness or truth , seem to make their principal and most zealous effort against this part of the plan . *stop*
It may therefore be satisfactory to analyze the arguments with which they combat it . *stop*
Those of them which have been most labored with that view , seem in substance to amount to this : `` It is not true , because the exigencies of the Union may not be susceptible of limitation , that its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined . *stop*
Revenue is as requisite to the purposes of the local administrations as to those of the Union ; and the former are at least of equal importance with the latter to the happiness of the people . *stop*
It is , therefore , as necessary that the State governments should be able to command the means of supplying their wants , as that the national government should possess the like faculty in respect to the wants of the Union . *stop*
But an indefinite power of taxation in the LATTER might , and probably would in time , deprive the FORMER of the means of providing for their own necessities ; and would subject them entirely to the mercy of the national legislature . *stop*
As the laws of the Union are to become the supreme law of the land , as it is to have power to pass all laws that may be NECESSARY for carrying into execution the authorities with which it is proposed to vest it , the national government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for State objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own . *stop*
It might allege a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy to the national revenues . *stop*
And thus all the resources of taxation might by degrees become the subjects of federal monopoly , to the entire exclusion and destruction of the State governments . '' *stop*
This mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon the supposition of usurpation in the national government ; at other times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the constitutional operation of its intended powers . *stop*
It is only in the latter light that it can be admitted to have any pretensions to fairness . *stop*
The moment we launch into conjectures about the usurpations of the federal government , we get into an unfathomable abyss , and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning . *stop*
Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle , and knows not on which side to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has so rashly adventured . *stop*
Whatever may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the Union , it is easy to imagine an endless train of possible dangers ; and by indulging an excess of jealousy and timidity , we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism and irresolution . *stop*
I repeat here what I have observed in substance in another place , that all observations founded upon the danger of usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of the government , not to the nature or extent of its powers . *stop*
The State governments , by their original constitutions , are invested with complete sovereignty . *stop*
In what does our security consist against usurpation from that quarter ? *stop*
Doubtless in the manner of their formation , and in a due dependence of those who are to administer them upon the people . *stop*
If the proposed construction of the federal government be found , upon an impartial examination of it , to be such as to afford , to a proper extent , the same species of security , all apprehensions on the score of usurpation ought to be discarded . *stop*
It should not be forgotten that a disposition in the State governments to encroach upon the rights of the Union is quite as probable as a disposition in the Union to encroach upon the rights of the State governments . *stop*
What side would be likely to prevail in such a conflict , must depend on the means which the contending parties could employ toward insuring success . *stop*
As in republics strength is always on the side of the people , and as there are weighty reasons to induce a belief that the State governments will commonly possess most influence over them , the natural conclusion is that such contests will be most apt to end to the disadvantage of the Union ; and that there is greater probability of encroachments by the members upon the federal head , than by the federal head upon the members . *stop*
But it is evident that all conjectures of this kind must be extremely vague and fallible : and that it is by far the safest course to lay them altogether aside , and to confine our attention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are delineated in the Constitution . *stop*
Every thing beyond this must be left to the prudence and firmness of the people ; who , as they will hold the scales in their own hands , it is to be hoped , will always take care to preserve the constitutional equilibrium between the general and the State governments . *stop*
Upon this ground , which is evidently the true one , it will not be difficult to obviate the objections which have been made to an indefinite power of taxation in the United States . *stop*

32 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , January 2 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : ALTHOUGH I am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the State governments from a power in the Union to control them in the levies of money , because I am persuaded that the sense of the people , the extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the State governments , and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local administrations for local purposes , would be a complete barrier against the oppressive use of such a power ; yet I am willing here to allow , in its full extent , the justness of the reasoning which requires that the individual States should possess an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their own wants . *stop*
And making this concession , I affirm that ( with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports ) they would , under the plan of the convention , retain that authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense ; and that an attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of it , would be a violent assumption of power , unwarranted by any article or clause of its Constitution . *stop*
An entire consolidation of the States into one complete national sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts ; and whatever powers might remain in them , would be altogether dependent on the general will . *stop*
But as the plan of the convention aims only at a partial union or consolidation , the State governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had , and which were not , by that act , EXCLUSIVELY delegated to the United States . *stop*
This exclusive delegation , or rather this alienation , of State sovereignty , would only exist in three cases : where the Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union ; where it granted in one instance an authority to the Union , and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like authority ; and where it granted an authority to the Union , to which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally CONTRADICTORY and REPUGNANT . *stop*
I use these terms to distinguish this last case from another which might appear to resemble it , but which would , in fact , be essentially different ; I mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional interferences in the POLICY of any branch of administration , but would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority . *stop*
These three cases of exclusive jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the following instances : The last clause but one in the eighth section of the first article provides expressly that Congress shall exercise `` EXCLUSIVE LEGISLATION '' over the district to be appropriated as the seat of government . *stop*
This answers to the first case . *stop*
The first clause of the same section empowers Congress `` to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises '' ; and the second clause of the tenth section of the same article declares that , `` NO STATE SHALL , without the consent of Congress , lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports , except for the purpose of executing its inspection laws . '' *stop*
Hence would result an exclusive power in the Union to lay duties on imports and exports , with the particular exception mentioned ; but this power is abridged by another clause , which declares that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State ; in consequence of which qualification , it now only extends to the DUTIES ON IMPORTS . *stop*
This answers to the second case . *stop*
The third will be found in that clause which declares that Congress shall have power `` to establish an UNIFORM RULE of naturalization throughout the United States . '' *stop*
This must necessarily be exclusive ; because if each State had power to prescribe a DISTINCT RULE , there could not be a UNIFORM RULE . *stop*
A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter , but which is in fact widely different , affects the question immediately under consideration . *stop*
I mean the power of imposing taxes on all articles other than exports and imports . *stop*
This , I contend , is manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority in the United States and in the individual States . *stop*
There is plainly no expression in the granting clause which makes that power EXCLUSIVE in the Union . *stop*
There is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the States from exercising it . *stop*
So far is this from being the case , that a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced from the restraint laid upon the States in relation to duties on imports and exports . *stop*
This restriction implies an admission that , if it were not inserted , the States would possess the power it excludes ; and it implies a further admission , that as to all other taxes , the authority of the States remains undiminished . *stop*
In any other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous ; it would be unnecessary , because if the grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties implied the exclusion of the States , or even their subordination in this particular , there could be no need of such a restriction ; it would be dangerous , because the introduction of it leads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned , and which , if the reasoning of the objectors be just , could not have been intended ; I mean that the States , in all cases to which the restriction did not apply , would have a concurrent power of taxation with the Union . *stop*
The restriction in question amounts to what lawyers call a NEGATIVE PREGNANT that is , a NEGATION of one thing , and an AFFIRMANCE of another ; a negation of the authority of the States to impose taxes on imports and exports , and an affirmance of their authority to impose them on all other articles . *stop*
It would be mere sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them ABSOLUTELY from the imposition of taxes of the former kind , and to leave them at liberty to lay others SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL of the national legislature . *stop*
The restraining or prohibitory clause only says , that they shall not , WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS , lay such duties ; and if we are to understand this in the sense last mentioned , the Constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision for the sake of a very absurd conclusion ; which is , that the States , WITH THE CONSENT of the national legislature , might tax imports and exports ; and that they might tax every other article , UNLESS CONTROLLED by the same body . *stop*
If this was the intention , why not leave it , in the first instance , to what is alleged to be the natural operation of the original clause , conferring a general power of taxation upon the Union ? *stop*
It is evident that this could not have been the intention , and that it will not bear a construction of the kind . *stop*
As to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation in the States and in the Union , it can not be supported in that sense which would be requisite to work an exclusion of the States . *stop*
It is , indeed , possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a State which might render it INEXPEDIENT that thus a further tax should be laid on the same article by the Union ; but it would not imply a constitutional inability to impose a further tax . *stop*
The quantity of the imposition , the expediency or inexpediency of an increase on either side , would be mutually questions of prudence ; but there would be involved no direct contradiction of power . *stop*
The particular policy of the national and of the State systems of finance might now and then not exactly coincide , and might require reciprocal forbearances . *stop*
It is not , however a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers , but an immediate constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and extinguish a pre-existing right of sovereignty . *stop*
The necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases results from the division of the sovereign power ; and the rule that all authorities , of which the States are not explicitly divested in favor of the Union , remain with them in full vigor , is not a theoretical consequence of that division , but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the proposed Constitution . *stop*
We there find that , notwithstanding the affirmative grants of general authorities , there has been the most pointed care in those cases where it was deemed improper that the like authorities should reside in the States , to insert negative clauses prohibiting the exercise of them by the States . *stop*
The tenth section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions . *stop*
This circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the convention , and furnishes a rule of interpretation out of the body of the act , which justifies the position I have advanced and refutes every hypothesis to the contrary . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
33 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , January 2 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE residue of the argument against the provisions of the Constitution in respect to taxation is ingrafted upon the following clause . *stop*
The last clause of the eighth section of the first article of the plan under consideration authorizes the national legislature `` to make all laws which shall be NECESSARY and PROPER for carrying into execution THE POWERS by that Constitution vested in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof '' ; and the second clause of the sixth article declares , `` that the Constitution and the laws of the United States made IN PURSUANCE THEREOF , and the treaties made by their authority shall be the SUPREME LAW of the land , any thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . '' *stop*
These two clauses have been the source of much virulent invective and petulant declamation against the proposed Constitution . *stop*
They have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colors of misrepresentation as the pernicious engines by which their local governments were to be destroyed and their liberties exterminated ; as the hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex nor age , nor high nor low , nor sacred nor profane ; and yet , strange as it may appear , after all this clamor , to those who may not have happened to contemplate them in the same light , it may be affirmed with perfect confidence that the constitutional operation of the intended government would be precisely the same , if these clauses were entirely obliterated , as if they were repeated in every article . *stop*
They are only declaratory of a truth which would have resulted by necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of constituting a federal government , and vesting it with certain specified powers . *stop*
This is so clear a proposition , that moderation itself can scarcely listen to the railings which have been so copiously vented against this part of the plan , without emotions that disturb its equanimity . *stop*
What is a power , but the ability or faculty of doing a thing ? *stop*
What is the ability to do a thing , but the power of employing the MEANS necessary to its execution ? *stop*
What is a LEGISLATIVE power , but a power of making LAWS ? *stop*
What are the MEANS to execute a LEGISLATIVE power but LAWS ? *stop*
What is the power of laying and collecting taxes , but a LEGISLATIVE POWER , or a power of MAKING LAWS , to lay and collect taxes ? *stop*
What are the proper means of executing such a power , but NECESSARY and PROPER laws ? *stop*
This simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by which to judge of the true nature of the clause complained of . *stop*
It conducts us to this palpable truth , that a power to lay and collect taxes must be a power to pass all laws NECESSARY and PROPER for the execution of that power ; and what does the unfortunate and calumniated provision in question do more than declare the same truth , to wit , that the national legislature , to whom the power of laying and collecting taxes had been previously given , might , in the execution of that power , pass all laws NECESSARY and PROPER to carry it into effect ? *stop*
I have applied these observations thus particularly to the power of taxation , because it is the immediate subject under consideration , and because it is the most important of the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the Union . *stop*
But the same process will lead to the same result , in relation to all other powers declared in the Constitution . *stop*
And it is EXPRESSLY to execute these powers that the sweeping clause , as it has been affectedly called , authorizes the national legislature to pass all NECESSARY and PROPER laws . *stop*
If there is any thing exceptionable , it must be sought for in the specific powers upon which this general declaration is predicated . *stop*
The declaration itself , though it may be chargeable with tautology or redundancy , is at least perfectly harmless . *stop*
But SUSPICION may ask , Why then was it introduced ? *stop*
The answer is , that it could only have been done for greater caution , and to guard against all cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimate authorities of the Union . *stop*
The Convention probably foresaw , what it has been a principal aim of these papers to inculcate , that the danger which most threatens our political welfare is that the State governments will finally sap the foundations of the Union ; and might therefore think it necessary , in so cardinal a point , to leave nothing to construction . *stop*
Whatever may have been the inducement to it , the wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been raised against it ; as that very cry betrays a disposition to question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the object of that provision to declare . *stop*
But it may be again asked , Who is to judge of the NECESSITY and PROPRIETY of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the Union ? *stop*
I answer , first , that this question arises as well and as fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory clause ; and I answer , in the second place , that the national government , like every other , must judge , in the first instance , of the proper exercise of its powers , and its constituents in the last . *stop*
If the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its authority and make a tyrannical use of its powers , the people , whose creature it is , must appeal to the standard they have formed , and take such measures to redress the injury done to the Constitution as the exigency may suggest and prudence justify . *stop*
The propriety of a law , in a constitutional light , must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded . *stop*
Suppose , by some forced constructions of its authority ( which , indeed , can not easily be imagined ) , the Federal legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any State , would it not be evident that , in making such an attempt , it had exceeded its jurisdiction , and infringed upon that of the State ? *stop*
Suppose , again , that upon the pretense of an interference with its revenues , it should undertake to abrogate a landtax imposed by the authority of a State ; would it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax , which its Constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State governments ? *stop*
If there ever should be a doubt on this head , the credit of it will be entirely due to those reasoners who , in the imprudent zeal of their animosity to the plan of the convention , have labored to envelop it in a cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest truths . *stop*
But it is said that the laws of the Union are to be the SUPREME LAW of the land . *stop*
But what inference can be drawn from this , or what would they amount to , if they were not to be supreme ? *stop*
It is evident they would amount to nothing . *stop*
A LAW , by the very meaning of the term , includes supremacy . *stop*
It is a rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound to observe . *stop*
This results from every political association . *stop*
If individuals enter into a state of society , the laws of that society must be the supreme regulator of their conduct . *stop*
If a number of political societies enter into a larger political society , the laws which the latter may enact , pursuant to the powers intrusted to it by its constitution , must necessarily be supreme over those societies , and the individuals of whom they are composed . *stop*
It would otherwise be a mere treaty , dependent on the good faith of the parties , and not a government , which is only another word for POLITICAL POWER AND SUPREMACY . *stop*
But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are NOT PURSUANT to its constitutional powers , but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies , will become the supreme law of the land . *stop*
These will be merely acts of usurpation , and will deserve to be treated as such . *stop*
Hence we perceive that the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the Union , like the one we have just before considered , only declares a truth , which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal government . *stop*
It will not , I presume , have escaped observation , that it EXPRESSLY confines this supremacy to laws made PURSUANT TO THE CONSTITUTION ; which I mention merely as an instance of caution in the convention ; since that limitation would have been to be understood , though it had not been expressed . *stop*
Though a law , therefore , laying a tax for the use of the United States would be supreme in its nature , and could not legally be opposed or controlled , yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of the State , ( unless upon imports and exports ) , would not be the supreme law of the land , but a usurpation of power not granted by the Constitution . *stop*
As far as an improper accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render the collection difficult or precarious , this would be a mutual inconvenience , not arising from a superiority or defect of power on either side , but from an injudicious exercise of power by one or the other , in a manner equally disadvantageous to both . *stop*
It is to be hoped and presumed , however , that mutual interest would dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material inconvenience . *stop*
The inference from the whole is , that the individual States would , under the proposed Constitution , retain an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise revenue to any extent of which they may stand in need , by every kind of taxation , except duties on imports and exports . *stop*
It will be shown in the next paper that this CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an entire subordination , in respect to this branch of power , of the State authority to that of the Union . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
34 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , January 5 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : I FLATTER myself it has been clearly shown in my last number that the particular States , under the proposed Constitution , would have COEQUAL authority with the Union in the article of revenue , except as to duties on imports . *stop*
As this leaves open to the States far the greatest part of the resources of the community , there can be no color for the assertion that they would not possess means as abundant as could be desired for the supply of their own wants , independent of all external control . *stop*
That the field is sufficiently wide will more fully appear when we come to advert to the inconsiderable share of the public expenses for which it will fall to the lot of the State governments to provide . *stop*
To argue upon abstract principles that this co-ordinate authority can not exist , is to set up supposition and theory against fact and reality . *stop*
However proper such reasonings might be to show that a thing OUGHT NOT TO EXIST , they are wholly to be rejected when they are made use of to prove that it does not exist contrary to the evidence of the fact itself . *stop*
It is well known that in the Roman republic the legislative authority , in the last resort , resided for ages in two different political bodies not as branches of the same legislature , but as distinct and independent legislatures , in each of which an opposite interest prevailed : in one the patrician ; in the other , the plebian . *stop*
Many arguments might have been adduced to prove the unfitness of two such seemingly contradictory authorities , each having power to ANNUL or REPEAL the acts of the other . *stop*
But a man would have been regarded as frantic who should have attempted at Rome to disprove their existence . *stop*
It will be readily understood that I allude to the COMITIA CENTURIATA and the COMITIA TRIBUTA . *stop*
The former , in which the people voted by centuries , was so arranged as to give a superiority to the patrician interest ; in the latter , in which numbers prevailed , the plebian interest had an entire predominancy . *stop*
And yet these two legislatures coexisted for ages , and the Roman republic attained to the utmost height of human greatness . *stop*
In the case particularly under consideration , there is no such contradiction as appears in the example cited ; there is no power on either side to annul the acts of the other . *stop*
And in practice there is little reason to apprehend any inconvenience ; because , in a short course of time , the wants of the States will naturally reduce themselves within A VERY NARROW COMPASS ; and in the interim , the United States will , in all probability , find it convenient to abstain wholly from those objects to which the particular States would be inclined to resort . *stop*
To form a more precise judgment of the true merits of this question , it will be well to advert to the proportion between the objects that will require a federal provision in respect to revenue , and those which will require a State provision . *stop*
We shall discover that the former are altogether unlimited , and that the latter are circumscribed within very moderate bounds . *stop*
In pursuing this inquiry , we must bear in mind that we are not to confine our view to the present period , but to look forward to remote futurity . *stop*
Constitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a calculation of existing exigencies , but upon a combination of these with the probable exigencies of ages , according to the natural and tried course of human affairs . *stop*
Nothing , therefore , can be more fallacious than to infer the extent of any power , proper to be lodged in the national government , from an estimate of its immediate necessities . *stop*
There ought to be a CAPACITY to provide for future contingencies as they may happen ; and as these are illimitable in their nature , it is impossible safely to limit that capacity . *stop*
It is true , perhaps , that a computation might be made with sufficient accuracy to answer the purpose of the quantity of revenue requisite to discharge the subsisting engagements of the Union , and to maintain those establishments which , for some time to come , would suffice in time of peace . *stop*
But would it be wise , or would it not rather be the extreme of folly , to stop at this point , and to leave the government intrusted with the care of the national defense in a state of absolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the community against future invasions of the public peace , by foreign war or domestic convulsions ? *stop*
If , on the contrary , we ought to exceed this point , where can we stop , short of an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they may arise ? *stop*
Though it is easy to assert , in general terms , the possibility of forming a rational judgment of a due provision against probable dangers , yet we may safely challenge those who make the assertion to bring forward their data , and may affirm that they would be found as vague and uncertain as any that could be produced to establish the probable duration of the world . *stop*
Observations confined to the mere prospects of internal attacks can deserve no weight ; though even these will admit of no satisfactory calculation : but if we mean to be a commercial people , it must form a part of our policy to be able one day to defend that commerce . *stop*
The support of a navy and of naval wars would involve contingencies that must baffle all the efforts of political arithmetic . *stop*
Admitting that we ought to try the novel and absurd experiment in politics of tying up the hands of government from offensive war founded upon reasons of state , yet certainly we ought not to disable it from guarding the community against the ambition or enmity of other nations . *stop*
A cloud has been for some time hanging over the European world . *stop*
If it should break forth into a storm , who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us ? *stop*
No reasonable man would hastily pronounce that we are entirely out of its reach . *stop*
Or if the combustible materials that now seem to be collecting should be dissipated without coming to maturity , or if a flame should be kindled without extending to us , what security can we have that our tranquillity will long remain undisturbed from some other cause or from some other quarter ? *stop*
Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our option ; that however moderate or unambitious we may be , we can not count upon the moderation , or hope to extinguish the ambition of others . *stop*
Who could have imagined at the conclusion of the last war that France and Britain , wearied and exhausted as they both were , would so soon have looked with so hostile an aspect upon each other ? *stop*
To judge from the history of mankind , we shall be compelled to conclude that the fiery and destructive passions of war reign in the human breast with much more powerful sway than the mild and beneficent sentiments of peace ; and that to model our political systems upon speculations of lasting tranquillity , is to calculate on the weaker springs of the human character . *stop*
What are the chief sources of expense in every government ? *stop*
What has occasioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which several of the European nations are oppressed ? *stop*
The answers plainly is , wars and rebellions ; the support of those institutions which are necessary to guard the body politic against these two most mortal diseases of society . *stop*
The expenses arising from those institutions which are relative to the mere domestic police of a state , to the support of its legislative , executive , and judicial departments , with their different appendages , and to the encouragement of agriculture and manufactures ( which will comprehend almost all the objects of state expenditure ) , are insignificant in comparison with those which relate to the national defense . *stop*
In the kingdom of Great Britain , where all the ostentatious apparatus of monarchy is to be provided for , not above a fifteenth part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the class of expenses last mentioned ; the other fourteen fifteenths are absorbed in the payment of the interest of debts contracted for carrying on the wars in which that country has been engaged , and in the maintenance of fleets and armies . *stop*
If , on the one hand , it should be observed that the expenses incurred in the prosecution of the ambitious enterprises and vainglorious pursuits of a monarchy are not a proper standard by which to judge of those which might be necessary in a republic , it ought , on the other hand , to be remarked that there should be as great a disproportion between the profusion and extravagance of a wealthy kingdom in its domestic administration , and the frugality and economy which in that particular become the modest simplicity of republican government . *stop*
If we balance a proper deduction from one side against that which it is supposed ought to be made from the other , the proportion may still be considered as holding good . *stop*
But let us advert to the large debt which we have ourselves contracted in a single war , and let us only calculate on a common share of the events which disturb the peace of nations , and we shall instantly perceive , without the aid of any elaborate illustration , that there must always be an immense disproportion between the objects of federal and state expenditures . *stop*
It is true that several of the States , separately , are encumbered with considerable debts , which are an excrescence of the late war . *stop*
But this can not happen again , if the proposed system be adopted ; and when these debts are discharged , the only call for revenue of any consequence , which the State governments will continue to experience , will be for the mere support of their respective civil list ; to which , if we add all contingencies , the total amount in every State ought to fall considerably short of two hundred thousand pounds . *stop*
In framing a government for posterity as well as ourselves , we ought , in those provisions which are designed to be permanent , to calculate , not on temporary , but on permanent causes of expense . *stop*
If this principle be a just one our attention would be directed to a provision in favor of the State governments for an annual sum of about two hundred thousand pounds ; while the exigencies of the Union could be susceptible of no limits , even in imagination . *stop*
In this view of the subject , by what logic can it be maintained that the local governments ought to command , in perpetuity , an EXCLUSIVE source of revenue for any sum beyond the extent of two hundred thousand pounds ? *stop*
To extend its power further , in EXCLUSION of the authority of the Union , would be to take the resources of the community out of those hands which stood in need of them for the public welfare , in order to put them into other hands which could have no just or proper occasion for them . *stop*
Suppose , then , the convention had been inclined to proceed upon the principle of a repartition of the objects of revenue , between the Union and its members , in PROPORTION to their comparative necessities ; what particular fund could have been selected for the use of the States , that would not either have been too much or too little too little for their present , too much for their future wants ? *stop*
As to the line of separation between external and internal taxes , this would leave to the States , at a rough computation , the command of two thirds of the resources of the community to defray from a tenth to a twentieth part of its expenses ; and to the Union , one third of the resources of the community , to defray from nine tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expenses . *stop*
If we desert this boundary and content ourselves with leaving to the States an exclusive power of taxing houses and lands , there would still be a great disproportion between the MEANS and the END ; the possession of one third of the resources of the community to supply , at most , one tenth of its wants . *stop*
If any fund could have been selected and appropriated , equal to and not greater than the object , it would have been inadequate to the discharge of the existing debts of the particular States , and would have left them dependent on the Union for a provision for this purpose . *stop*
The preceding train of observation will justify the position which has been elsewhere laid down , that `` A CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an entire subordination , in respect to this branch of power , of State authority to that of the Union . '' *stop*
Any separation of the objects of revenue that could have been fallen upon , would have amounted to a sacrifice of the great INTERESTS of the Union to the POWER of the individual States . *stop*
The convention thought the concurrent jurisdiction preferable to that subordination ; and it is evident that it has at least the merit of reconciling an indefinite constitutional power of taxation in the Federal government with an adequate and independent power in the States to provide for their own necessities . *stop*
There remain a few other lights , in which this important subject of taxation will claim a further consideration . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
35 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , January 5 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : BEFORE we proceed to examine any other objections to an indefinite power of taxation in the Union , I shall make one general remark ; which is , that if the jurisdiction of the national government , in the article of revenue , should be restricted to particular objects , it would naturally occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to fall upon those objects . *stop*
Two evils would spring from this source : the oppression of particular branches of industry ; and an unequal distribution of the taxes , as well among the several States as among the citizens of the same State . *stop*
Suppose , as has been contended for , the federal power of taxation were to be confined to duties on imports , it is evident that the government , for want of being able to command other resources , would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an injurious excess . *stop*
There are persons who imagine that they can never be carried to too great a length ; since the higher they are , the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant consumption , to produce a favorable balance of trade , and to promote domestic manufactures . *stop*
But all extremes are pernicious in various ways . *stop*
Exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general spirit of smuggling ; which is always prejudicial to the fair trader , and eventually to the revenue itself : they tend to render other classes of the community tributary , in an improper degree , to the manufacturing classes , to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets ; they sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with less advantage ; and in the last place , they oppress the merchant , who is often obliged to pay them himself without any retribution from the consumer . *stop*
When the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market , the consumer generally pays the duty ; but when the markets happen to be overstocked , a great proportion falls upon the merchant , and sometimes not only exhausts his profits , but breaks in upon his capital . *stop*
I am apt to think that a division of the duty , between the seller and the buyer , more often happens than is commonly imagined . *stop*
It is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity in exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it . *stop*
The merchant , especially in a country of small commercial capital , is often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more expeditious sale . *stop*
The maxim that the consumer is the payer , is so much oftener true than the reverse of the proposition , that it is far more equitable that the duties on imports should go into a common stock , than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing States . *stop*
But it is not so generally true as to render it equitable , that those duties should form the only national fund . *stop*
When they are paid by the merchant they operate as an additional tax upon the importing State , whose citizens pay their proportion of them in the character of consumers . *stop*
In this view they are productive of inequality among the States ; which inequality would be increased with the increased extent of the duties . *stop*
The confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts would be attended with inequality , from a different cause , between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States . *stop*
The States which can go farthest towards the supply of their own wants , by their own manufactures , will not , according to their numbers or wealth , consume so great a proportion of imported articles as those States which are not in the same favorable situation . *stop*
They would not , therefore , in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abilities . *stop*
To make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to excises , the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures . *stop*
New York is more deeply interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the Union to external taxation may be aware of . *stop*
New York is an importing State , and is not likely speedily to be , to any great extent , a manufacturing State . *stop*
She would , of course , suffer in a double light from restraining the jurisdiction of the Union to commercial imposts . *stop*
So far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be observed , conformably to a remark made in another part of these papers , that the interest of the revenue itself would be a sufficient guard against such an extreme . *stop*
I readily admit that this would be the case , as long as other resources were open ; but if the avenues to them were closed , HOPE , stimulated by necessity , would beget experiments , fortified by rigorous precautions and additional penalties , which , for a time , would have the intended effect , till there had been leisure to contrive expedients to elude these new precautions . *stop*
The first success would be apt to inspire false opinions , which it might require a long course of subsequent experience to correct . *stop*
Necessity , especially in politics , often occasions false hopes , false reasonings , and a system of measures correspondingly erroneous . *stop*
But even if this supposed excess should not be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of taxation , the inequalities spoken of would still ensue , though not in the same degree , from the other causes that have been noticed . *stop*
Let us now return to the examination of objections . *stop*
One which , if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition , seems most to be relied on , is , that the House of Representatives is not sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different classes of citizens , in order to combine the interests and feelings of every part of the community , and to produce a due sympathy between the representative body and its constituents . *stop*
This argument presents itself under a very specious and seducing form ; and is well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is addressed . *stop*
But when we come to dissect it with attention , it will appear to be made up of nothing but fair-sounding words . *stop*
The object it seems to aim at is , in the first place , impracticable , and in the sense in which it is contended for , is unnecessary . *stop*
I reserve for another place the discussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the representative body in respect to numbers , and shall content myself with examining here the particular use which has been made of a contrary supposition , in reference to the immediate subject of our inquiries . *stop*
The idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people , by persons of each class , is altogether visionary . *stop*
Unless it were expressly provided in the Constitution , that each different occupation should send one or more members , the thing would never take place in practice . *stop*
Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined , with few exceptions , to give their votes to merchants , in preference to persons of their own professions or trades . *stop*
Those discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise and industry . *stop*
Many of them , indeed , are immediately connected with the operations of commerce . *stop*
They know that the merchant is their natural patron and friend ; and they are aware , that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense , their interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by themselves . *stop*
They are sensible that their habits in life have not been such as to give them those acquired endowments , without which , in a deliberative assembly , the greatest natural abilities are for the most part useless ; and that the influence and weight , and superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the public councils , unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading interests . *stop*
These considerations , and many others that might be mentioned prove , and experience confirms it , that artisans and manufacturers will commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon merchants and those whom they recommend . *stop*
We must therefore consider merchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the community . *stop*
With regard to the learned professions , little need be observed ; they truly form no distinct interest in society , and according to their situation and talents , will be indiscriminately the objects of the confidence and choice of each other , and of other parts of the community . *stop*
Nothing remains but the landed interest ; and this , in a political view , and particularly in relation to taxes , I take to be perfectly united , from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest tenant . *stop*
No tax can be laid on land which will not affect the proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a single acre . *stop*
Every landholder will therefore have a common interest to keep the taxes on land as low as possible ; and common interest may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of sympathy . *stop*
But if we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer , what reason is there to conclude , that the first would stand a better chance of being deputed to the national legislature than the last ? *stop*
If we take fact as our guide , and look into our own senate and assembly , we shall find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both ; nor is this less the case in the senate , which consists of a smaller number , than in the assembly , which is composed of a greater number . *stop*
Where the qualifications of the electors are the same , whether they have to choose a small or a large number , their votes will fall upon those in whom they have most confidence ; whether these happen to be men of large fortunes , or of moderate property , or of no property at all . *stop*
It is said to be necessary , that all classes of citizens should have some of their own number in the representative body , in order that their feelings and interests may be the better understood and attended to . *stop*
But we have seen that this will never happen under any arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free . *stop*
Where this is the case , the representative body , with too few exceptions to have any influence on the spirit of the government , will be composed of landholders , merchants , and men of the learned professions . *stop*
But where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these three descriptions of men ? *stop*
Will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property ? *stop*
And will he not , from his own interest in that species of property , be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or encumber it ? *stop*
Will not the merchant understand and be disposed to cultivate , as far as may be proper , the interests of the mechanic and manufacturing arts , to which his commerce is so nearly allied ? *stop*
Will not the man of the learned profession , who will feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of industry , be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them , ready to promote either , so far as it shall appear to him conducive to the general interests of the society ? *stop*
If we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions which may happen to prevail in particular parts of the society , and to which a wise administration will never be inattentive , is the man whose situation leads to extensive inquiry and information less likely to be a competent judge of their nature , extent , and foundation than one whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and acquaintances ? *stop*
Is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favor of the people , and who is dependent on the suffrages of his fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors , should take care to inform himself of their dispositions and inclinations , and should be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct ? *stop*
This dependence , and the necessity of being bound himself , and his posterity , by the laws to which he gives his assent , are the true , and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the representative and the constituent . *stop*
There is no part of the administration of government that requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of political economy , so much as the business of taxation . *stop*
The man who understands those principles best will be least likely to resort to oppressive expedients , or sacrifice any particular class of citizens to the procurement of revenue . *stop*
It might be demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always be the least burdensome . *stop*
There can be no doubt that in order to a judicious exercise of the power of taxation , it is necessary that the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general genius , habits , and modes of thinking of the people at large , and with the resources of the country . *stop*
And this is all that can be reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the people . *stop*
In any other sense the proposition has either no meaning , or an absurd one . *stop*
And in that sense let every considerate citizen judge for himself where the requisite qualification is most likely to be found . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
36 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the General Power of Taxation ) From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , January 8 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : WE HAVE seen that the result of the observations , to which the foregoing number has been principally devoted , is , that from the natural operation of the different interests and views of the various classes of the community , whether the representation of the people be more or less numerous , it will consist almost entirely of proprietors of land , of merchants , and of members of the learned professions , who will truly represent all those different interests and views . *stop*
If it should be objected that we have seen other descriptions of men in the local legislatures , I answer that it is admitted there are exceptions to the rule , but not in sufficient number to influence the general complexion or character of the government . *stop*
There are strong minds in every walk of life that will rise superior to the disadvantages of situation , and will command the tribute due to their merit , not only from the classes to which they particularly belong , but from the society in general . *stop*
The door ought to be equally open to all ; and I trust , for the credit of human nature , that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of State legislation ; but occasional instances of this sort will not render the reasoning founded upon the general course of things , less conclusive . *stop*
The subject might be placed in several other lights that would all lead to the same result ; and in particular it might be asked , What greater affinity or relation of interest can be conceived between the carpenter and blacksmith , and the linen manufacturer or stocking weaver , than between the merchant and either of them ? *stop*
It is notorious that there are often as great rivalships between different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts as there are between any of the departments of labor and industry ; so that , unless the representative body were to be far more numerous than would be consistent with any idea of regularity or wisdom in its deliberations , it is impossible that what seems to be the spirit of the objection we have been considering should ever be realized in practice . *stop*
But I forbear to dwell any longer on a matter which has hitherto worn too loose a garb to admit even of an accurate inspection of its real shape or tendency . *stop*
There is another objection of a somewhat more precise nature that claims our attention . *stop*
It has been asserted that a power of internal taxation in the national legislature could never be exercised with advantage , as well from the want of a sufficient knowledge of local circumstances , as from an interference between the revenue laws of the Union and of the particular States . *stop*
The supposition of a want of proper knowledge seems to be entirely destitute of foundation . *stop*
If any question is depending in a State legislature respecting one of the counties , which demands a knowledge of local details , how is it acquired ? *stop*
No doubt from the information of the members of the county . *stop*
Can not the like knowledge be obtained in the national legislature from the representatives of each State ? *stop*
And is it not to be presumed that the men who will generally be sent there will be possessed of the necessary degree of intelligence to be able to communicate that information ? *stop*
Is the knowledge of local circumstances , as applied to taxation , a minute topographical acquaintance with all the mountains , rivers , streams , highways , and bypaths in each State ; or is it a general acquaintance with its situation and resources , with the state of its agriculture , commerce , manufactures , with the nature of its products and consumptions , with the different degrees and kinds of its wealth , property , and industry ? *stop*
Nations in general , even under governments of the more popular kind , usually commit the administration of their finances to single men or to boards composed of a few individuals , who digest and prepare , in the first instance , the plans of taxation , which are afterwards passed into laws by the authority of the sovereign or legislature . *stop*
Inquisitive and enlightened statesmen are deemed everywhere best qualified to make a judicious selection of the objects proper for revenue ; which is a clear indication , as far as the sense of mankind can have weight in the question , of the species of knowledge of local circumstances requisite to the purposes of taxation . *stop*
The taxes intended to be comprised under the general denomination of internal taxes may be subdivided into those of the DIRECT and those of the INDIRECT kind . *stop*
Though the objection be made to both , yet the reasoning upon it seems to be confined to the former branch . *stop*
And indeed , as to the latter , by which must be understood duties and excises on articles of consumption , one is at a loss to conceive what can be the nature of the difficulties apprehended . *stop*
The knowledge relating to them must evidently be of a kind that will either be suggested by the nature of the article itself , or can easily be procured from any well-informed man , especially of the mercantile class . *stop*
The circumstances that may distinguish its situation in one State from its situation in another must be few , simple , and easy to be comprehended . *stop*
The principal thing to be attended to , would be to avoid those articles which had been previously appropriated to the use of a particular State ; and there could be no difficulty in ascertaining the revenue system of each . *stop*
This could always be known from the respective codes of laws , as well as from the information of the members from the several States . *stop*
The objection , when applied to real property or to houses and lands , appears to have , at first sight , more foundation , but even in this view it will not bear a close examination . *stop*
Land taxes are commonly laid in one of two modes , either by ACTUAL valuations , permanent or periodical , or by OCCASIONAL assessments , at the discretion , or according to the best judgment , of certain officers whose duty it is to make them . *stop*
In either case , the EXECUTION of the business , which alone requires the knowledge of local details , must be devolved upon discreet persons in the character of commissioners or assessors , elected by the people or appointed by the government for the purpose . *stop*
All that the law can do must be to name the persons or to prescribe the manner of their election or appointment , to fix their numbers and qualifications and to draw the general outlines of their powers and duties . *stop*
And what is there in all this that can not as well be performed by the national legislature as by a State legislature ? *stop*
The attention of either can only reach to general principles ; local details , as already observed , must be referred to those who are to execute the plan . *stop*
But there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be placed that must be altogether satisfactory . *stop*
The national legislature can make use of the SYSTEM OF EACH STATE WITHIN THAT STATE . *stop*
The method of laying and collecting this species of taxes in each State can , in all its parts , be adopted and employed by the federal government . *stop*
Let it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not to be left to the discretion of the national legislature , but is to be determined by the numbers of each State , as described in the second section of the first article . *stop*
An actual census or enumeration of the people must furnish the rule , a circumstance which effectually shuts the door to partiality or oppression . *stop*
The abuse of this power of taxation seems to have been provided against with guarded circumspection . *stop*
In addition to the precaution just mentioned , there is a provision that '' all duties , imposts , and excises shall be UNIFORM throughout the United States . '' *stop*
It has been very properly observed by different speakers and writers on the side of the Constitution , that if the exercise of the power of internal taxation by the Union should be discovered on experiment to be really inconvenient , the federal government may then forbear the use of it , and have recourse to requisitions in its stead . *stop*
By way of answer to this , it has been triumphantly asked , Why not in the first instance omit that ambiguous power , and rely upon the latter resource ? *stop*
Two solid answers may be given . *stop*
The first is , that the exercise of that power , if convenient , will be preferable , because it will be more effectual ; and it is impossible to prove in theory , or otherwise than by the experiment , that it can not be advantageously exercised . *stop*
The contrary , indeed , appears most probable . *stop*
The second answer is , that the existence of such a power in the Constitution will have a strong influence in giving efficacy to requisitions . *stop*
When the States know that the Union can apply itself without their agency , it will be a powerful motive for exertion on their part . *stop*
As to the interference of the revenue laws of the Union , and of its members , we have already seen that there can be no clashing or repugnancy of authority . *stop*
The laws can not , therefore , in a legal sense , interfere with each other ; and it is far from impossible to avoid an interference even in the policy of their different systems . *stop*
An effectual expedient for this purpose will be , mutually , to abstain from those objects which either side may have first had recourse to . *stop*
As neither can CONTROL the other , each will have an obvious and sensible interest in this reciprocal forbearance . *stop*
And where there is an IMMEDIATE common interest , we may safely count upon its operation . *stop*
When the particular debts of the States are done away , and their expenses come to be limited within their natural compass , the possibility almost of interference will vanish . *stop*
A small land tax will answer the purpose of the States , and will be their most simple and most fit resource . *stop*
Many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal taxation , to excite the apprehensions of the people : double sets of revenue officers , a duplication of their burdens by double taxations , and the frightful forms of odious and oppressive poll-taxes , have been played off with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain . *stop*
As to the first point , there are two cases in which there can be no room for double sets of officers : one , where the right of imposing the tax is exclusively vested in the Union , which applies to the duties on imports ; the other , where the object has not fallen under any State regulation or provision , which may be applicable to a variety of objects . *stop*
In other cases , the probability is that the United States will either wholly abstain from the objects preoccupied for local purposes , or will make use of the State officers and State regulations for collecting the additional imposition . *stop*
This will best answer the views of revenue , because it will save expense in the collection , and will best avoid any occasion of disgust to the State governments and to the people . *stop*
At all events , here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an inconvenience ; and nothing more can be required than to show that evils predicted to not necessarily result from the plan . *stop*
As to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence , it is a sufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed ; but the supposition is susceptible of a more precise answer . *stop*
If such a spirit should infest the councils of the Union , the most certain road to the accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the State officers as much as possible , and to attach them to the Union by an accumulation of their emoluments . *stop*
This would serve to turn the tide of State influence into the channels of the national government , instead of making federal influence flow in an opposite and adverse current . *stop*
But all suppositions of this kind are invidious , and ought to be banished from the consideration of the great question before the people . *stop*
They can answer no other end than to cast a mist over the truth . *stop*
As to the suggestion of double taxation , the answer is plain . *stop*
The wants of the Union are to be supplied in one way or another ; if to be done by the authority of the federal government , it will not be to be done by that of the State government . *stop*
The quantity of taxes to be paid by the community must be the same in either case ; with this advantage , if the provision is to be made by the Union that the capital resource of commercial imposts , which is the most convenient branch of revenue , can be prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under State regulation , and of course will render it less necessary to recur to more inconvenient methods ; and with this further advantage , that as far as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of internal taxation , it will impose a disposition to greater care in the choice and arrangement of the means ; and must naturally tend to make it a fixed point of policy in the national administration to go as far as may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the public treasury , in order to diminish the necessity of those impositions which might create dissatisfaction in the poorer and most numerous classes of the society . *stop*
Happy it is when the interest which the government has in the preservation of its own power , coincides with a proper distribution of the public burdens , and tends to guard the least wealthy part of the community from oppression ! *stop*
As to poll taxes , I , without scruple , confess my disapprobation of them ; and though they have prevailed from an early period in those States which have uniformly been the most tenacious of their rights , I should lament to see them introduced into practice under the national government . *stop*
But does it follow because there is a power to lay them that they will actually be laid ? *stop*
Every State in the Union has power to impose taxes of this kind ; and yet in several of them they are unknown in practice . *stop*
Are the State governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies , because they possess this power ? *stop*
If they are not , with what propriety can the like power justify such a charge against the national government , or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption ? *stop*
As little friendly as I am to the species of imposition , I still feel a thorough conviction that the power of having recourse to it ought to exist in the federal government . *stop*
There are certain emergencies of nations , in which expedients , that in the ordinary state of things ought to be forborne , become essential to the public weal . *stop*
And the government , from the possibility of such emergencies , ought ever to have the option of making use of them . *stop*
The real scarcity of objects in this country , which may be considered as productive sources of revenue , is a reason peculiar to itself , for not abridging the discretion of the national councils in this respect . *stop*
There may exist certain critical and tempestuous conjunctures of the State , in which a poll tax may become an inestimable resource . *stop*
And as I know nothing to exempt this portion of the globe from the common calamities that have befallen other parts of it , I acknowledge my aversion to every project that is calculated to disarm the government of a single weapon , which in any possible contingency might be usefully employed for the general defense and security . *stop*
( I have now gone through the examination of such of the powers proposed to be vested in the United States , which may be considered as having an immediate relation to the energy of the government ; and have endeavored to answer the principal objections which have been made to them . *stop*
I have passed over in silence those minor authorities , which are either too inconsiderable to have been thought worthy of the hostilities of the opponents of the Constitution , or of too manifest propriety to admit of controversy . *stop*
The mass of judiciary power , however , might have claimed an investigation under this head , had it not been for the consideration that its organization and its extent may be more advantageously considered in connection . *stop*
This has determined me to refer it to the branch of our inquiries upon which we shall next enter . ) *stop*
( I have now gone through the examination of those powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government which relate more peculiarly to its energy , and to its efficiency for answering the great and primary objects of union . *stop*
There are others which , though omitted here , will , in order to render the view of the subject more complete , be taken notice of under the next head of our inquiries . *stop*
I flatter myself the progress already made will have sufficed to satisfy the candid and judicious part of the community that some of the objections which have been most strenuously urged against the Constitution , and which were most formidable in their first appearance , are not only destitute of substance , but if they had operated in the formation of the plan , would have rendered it incompetent to the great ends of public happiness and national prosperity . *stop*
I equally flatter myself that a further and more critical investigation of the system will serve to recommend it still more to every sincere and disinterested advocate for good government and will leave no doubt with men of this character of the propriety and expediency of adopting it . *stop*
Happy will it be for ourselves , and more honorable for human nature , if we have wisdom and virtue enough to set so glorious an example to mankind ! ) *stop*

59 Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members From the New York Packet . *stop*
Friday , February 22 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE natural order of the subject leads us to consider , in this place , that provision of the Constitution which authorizes the national legislature to regulate , in the last resort , the election of its own members . *stop*
It is in these words : `` The TIMES , PLACES , and MANNER of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof ; but the Congress may , at any time , by law , make or alter SUCH REGULATIONS , except as to the PLACES of choosing senators . '' *stop*
This provision has not only been declaimed against by those who condemn the Constitution in the gross , but it has been censured by those who have objected with less latitude and greater moderation ; and , in one instance it has been thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the advocate of every other part of the system . *stop*
I am greatly mistaken , notwithstanding , if there be any article in the whole plan more completely defensible than this . *stop*
Its propriety rests upon the evidence of this plain proposition , that EVERY GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO CONTAIN IN ITSELF THE MEANS OF ITS OWN PRESERVATION . *stop*
Every just reasoner will , at first sight , approve an adherence to this rule , in the work of the convention ; and will disapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the work some particular ingredient , with which a rigid conformity to the rule was incompatible . *stop*
Even in this case , though he may acquiesce in the necessity , yet he will not cease to regard and to regret a departure from so fundamental a principle , as a portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of future weakness , and perhaps anarchy . *stop*
It will not be alleged , that an election law could have been framed and inserted in the Constitution , which would have been always applicable to every probable change in the situation of the country ; and it will therefore not be denied , that a discretionary power over elections ought to exist somewhere . *stop*
It will , I presume , be as readily conceded , that there were only three ways in which this power could have been reasonably modified and disposed : that it must either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature , or wholly in the State legislatures , or primarily in the latter and ultimately in the former . *stop*
The last mode has , with reason , been preferred by the convention . *stop*
They have submitted the regulation of elections for the federal government , in the first instance , to the local administrations ; which , in ordinary cases , and when no improper views prevail , may be both more convenient and more satisfactory ; but they have reserved to the national authority a right to interpose , whenever extraordinary circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its safety . *stop*
Nothing can be more evident , than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the national government , in the hands of the State legislatures , would leave the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy . *stop*
They could at any moment annihilate it , by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to administer its affairs . *stop*
It is to little purpose to say , that a neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take place . *stop*
The constitutional possibility of the thing , without an equivalent for the risk , is an unanswerable objection . *stop*
Nor has any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that risk . *stop*
The extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can never be dignified with that character . *stop*
If we are in a humor to presume abuses of power , it is as fair to presume them on the part of the State governments as on the part of the general government . *stop*
And as it is more consonant to the rules of a just theory , to trust the Union with the care of its own existence , than to transfer that care to any other hands , if abuses of power are to be hazarded on the one side or on the other , it is more rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be placed , than where it would unnaturally be placed . *stop*
Suppose an article had been introduced into the Constitution , empowering the United States to regulate the elections for the particular States , would any man have hesitated to condemn it , both as an unwarrantable transposition of power , and as a premeditated engine for the destruction of the State governments ? *stop*
The violation of principle , in this case , would have required no comment ; and , to an unbiased observer , it will not be less apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the national government , in a similar respect , to the pleasure of the State governments . *stop*
An impartial view of the matter can not fail to result in a conviction , that each , as far as possible , ought to depend on itself for its own preservation . *stop*
As an objection to this position , it may be remarked that the constitution of the national Senate would involve , in its full extent , the danger which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the State legislatures to regulate the federal elections . *stop*
It may be alleged , that by declining the appointment of Senators , they might at any time give a fatal blow to the Union ; and from this it may be inferred , that as its existence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in so essential a point , there can be no objection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under consideration . *stop*
The interest of each State , it may be added , to maintain its representation in the national councils , would be a complete security against an abuse of the trust . *stop*
This argument , though specious , will not , upon examination , be found solid . *stop*
It is certainly true that the State legislatures , by forbearing the appointment of senators , may destroy the national government . *stop*
But it will not follow that , because they have a power to do this in one instance , they ought to have it in every other . *stop*
There are cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far more decisive , without any motive equally cogent with that which must have regulated the conduct of the convention in respect to the formation of the Senate , to recommend their admission into the system . *stop*
So far as that construction may expose the Union to the possibility of injury from the State legislatures , it is an evil ; but it is an evil which could not have been avoided without excluding the States , in their political capacities , wholly from a place in the organization of the national government . *stop*
If this had been done , it would doubtless have been interpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal principle ; and would certainly have deprived the State governments of that absolute safeguard which they will enjoy under this provision . *stop*
But however wise it may have been to have submitted in this instance to an inconvenience , for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a greater good , no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the evil , where no necessity urges , nor any greater good invites . *stop*
It may be easily discerned also that the national government would run a much greater risk from a power in the State legislatures over the elections of its House of Representatives , than from their power of appointing the members of its Senate . *stop*
The senators are to be chosen for the period of six years ; there is to be a rotation , by which the seats of a third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two years ; and no State is to be entitled to more than two senators ; a quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members . *stop*
The joint result of these circumstances would be , that a temporary combination of a few States to intermit the appointment of senators , could neither annul the existence nor impair the activity of the body ; and it is not from a general and permanent combination of the States that we can have any thing to fear . *stop*
The first might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members of a few of the State legislatures ; the last would suppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people , which will either never exist at all , or will , in all probability , proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the general government to the advancement of their happiness in which event no good citizen could desire its continuance . *stop*
But with regard to the federal House of Representatives , there is intended to be a general election of members once in two years . *stop*
If the State legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of regulating these elections , every period of making them would be a delicate crisis in the national situation , which might issue in a dissolution of the Union , if the leaders of a few of the most important States should have entered into a previous conspiracy to prevent an election . *stop*
I shall not deny , that there is a degree of weight in the observation , that the interests of each State , to be represented in the federal councils , will be a security against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of the State legislatures . *stop*
But the security will not be considered as complete , by those who attend to the force of an obvious distinction between the interest of the people in the public felicity , and the interest of their local rulers in the power and consequence of their offices . *stop*
The people of America may be warmly attached to the government of the Union , at times when the particular rulers of particular States , stimulated by the natural rivalship of power , and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement , and supported by a strong faction in each of those States , may be in a very opposite temper . *stop*
This diversity of sentiment between a majority of the people , and the individuals who have the greatest credit in their councils , is exemplified in some of the States at the present moment , on the present question . *stop*
The scheme of separate confederacies , which will always multiply the chances of ambition , will be a never failing bait to all such influential characters in the State administrations as are capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the public weal . *stop*
With so effectual a weapon in their hands as the exclusive power of regulating elections for the national government , a combination of a few such men , in a few of the most considerable States , where the temptation will always be the strongest , might accomplish the destruction of the Union , by seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the people ( and which perhaps they may themselves have excited ) , to discontinue the choice of members for the federal House of Representatives . *stop*
It ought never to be forgotten , that a firm union of this country , under an efficient government , will probably be an increasing object of jealousy to more than one nation of Europe ; and that enterprises to subvert it will sometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers , and will seldom fail to be patronized and abetted by some of them . *stop*
Its preservation , therefore ought in no case that can be avoided , to be committed to the guardianship of any but those whose situation will uniformly beget an immediate interest in the faithful and vigilant performance of the trust . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
60 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members ) From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , February 23 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : WE HAVE seen , that an uncontrollable power over the elections to the federal government could not , without hazard , be committed to the State legislatures . *stop*
Let us now see , what would be the danger on the other side ; that is , from confiding the ultimate right of regulating its own elections to the Union itself . *stop*
It is not pretended , that this right would ever be used for the exclusion of any State from its share in the representation . *stop*
The interest of all would , in this respect at least , be the security of all . *stop*
But it is alleged , that it might be employed in such a manner as to promote the election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others , by confining the places of election to particular districts , and rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in the choice . *stop*
Of all chimerical suppositions , this seems to be the most chimerical . *stop*
On the one hand , no rational calculation of probabilities would lead us to imagine that the disposition which a conduct so violent and extraordinary would imply , could ever find its way into the national councils ; and on the other , it may be concluded with certainty , that if so improper a spirit should ever gain admittance into them , it would display itself in a form altogether different and far more decisive . *stop*
The improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred from this single reflection , that it could never be made without causing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people , headed and directed by the State governments . *stop*
It is not difficult to conceive that this characteristic right of freedom may , in certain turbulent and factious seasons , be violated , in respect to a particular class of citizens , by a victorious and overbearing majority ; but that so fundamental a privilege , in a country so situated and enlightened , should be invaded to the prejudice of the great mass of the people , by the deliberate policy of the government , without occasioning a popular revolution , is altogether inconceivable and incredible . *stop*
In addition to this general reflection , there are considerations of a more precise nature , which forbid all apprehension on the subject . *stop*
The dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose the national government , and still more in the manner in which they will be brought into action in its various branches , must form a powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of elections . *stop*
There is sufficient diversity in the state of property , in the genius , manners , and habits of the people of the different parts of the Union , to occasion a material diversity of disposition in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions in society . *stop*
And though an intimate intercourse under the same government will promote a gradual assimilation in some of these respects , yet there are causes , as well physical as moral , which may , in a greater or less degree , permanently nourish different propensities and inclinations in this respect . *stop*
But the circumstance which will be likely to have the greatest influence in the matter , will be the dissimilar modes of constituting the several component parts of the government . *stop*
The House of Representatives being to be elected immediately by the people , the Senate by the State legislatures , the President by electors chosen for that purpose by the people , there would be little probability of a common interest to cement these different branches in a predilection for any particular class of electors . *stop*
As to the Senate , it is impossible that any regulation of `` time and manner , '' which is all that is proposed to be submitted to the national government in respect to that body , can affect the spirit which will direct the choice of its members . *stop*
The collective sense of the State legislatures can never be influenced by extraneous circumstances of that sort ; a consideration which alone ought to satisfy us that the discrimination apprehended would never be attempted . *stop*
For what inducement could the Senate have to concur in a preference in which itself would not be included ? *stop*
Or to what purpose would it be established , in reference to one branch of the legislature , if it could not be extended to the other ? *stop*
The composition of the one would in this case counteract that of the other . *stop*
And we can never suppose that it would embrace the appointments to the Senate , unless we can at the same time suppose the voluntary co-operation of the State legislatures . *stop*
If we make the latter supposition , it then becomes immaterial where the power in question is placed -- whether in their hands or in those of the Union . *stop*
But what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in the national councils ? *stop*
Is it to be exercised in a discrimination between the different departments of industry , or between the different kinds of property , or between the different degrees of property ? *stop*
Will it lean in favor of the landed interest , or the moneyed interest , or the mercantile interest , or the manufacturing interest ? *stop*
Or , to speak in the fashionable language of the adversaries to the Constitution , will it court the elevation of `` the wealthy and the well-born , '' to the exclusion and debasement of all the rest of the society ? *stop*
If this partiality is to be exerted in favor of those who are concerned in any particular description of industry or property , I presume it will readily be admitted , that the competition for it will lie between landed men and merchants . *stop*
And I scruple not to affirm , that it is infinitely less likely that either of them should gain an ascendant in the national councils , than that the one or the other of them should predominate in all the local councils . *stop*
The inference will be , that a conduct tending to give an undue preference to either is much less to be dreaded from the former than from the latter . *stop*
The several States are in various degrees addicted to agriculture and commerce . *stop*
In most , if not all of them , agriculture is predominant . *stop*
In a few of them , however , commerce nearly divides its empire , and in most of them has a considerable share of influence . *stop*
In proportion as either prevails , it will be conveyed into the national representation ; and for the very reason , that this will be an emanation from a greater variety of interests , and in much more various proportions , than are to be found in any single State , it will be much less apt to espouse either of them with a decided partiality , than the representation of any single State . *stop*
In a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land , where the rules of an equal representation obtain , the landed interest must , upon the whole , preponderate in the government . *stop*
As long as this interest prevails in most of the State legislatures , so long it must maintain a correspondent superiority in the national Senate , which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of those assemblies . *stop*
It can not therefore be presumed , that a sacrifice of the landed to the mercantile class will ever be a favorite object of this branch of the federal legislature . *stop*
In applying thus particularly to the Senate a general observation suggested by the situation of the country , I am governed by the consideration , that the credulous votaries of State power can not , upon their own principles , suspect , that the State legislatures would be warped from their duty by any external influence . *stop*
But in reality the same situation must have the same effect , in the primitive composition at least of the federal House of Representatives : an improper bias towards the mercantile class is as little to be expected from this quarter as from the other . *stop*
In order , perhaps , to give countenance to the objection at any rate , it may be asked , is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government , which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class ? *stop*
As there is little likelihood that the supposition of such a bias will have any terrors for those who would be immediately injured by it , a labored answer to this question will be dispensed with . *stop*
It will be sufficient to remark , first , that for the reasons elsewhere assigned , it is less likely that any decided partiality should prevail in the councils of the Union than in those of any of its members . *stop*
Secondly , that there would be no temptation to violate the Constitution in favor of the landed class , because that class would , in the natural course of things , enjoy as great a preponderancy as itself could desire . *stop*
And thirdly , that men accustomed to investigate the sources of public prosperity upon a large scale , must be too well convinced of the utility of commerce , to be inclined to inflict upon it so deep a wound as would result from the entire exclusion of those who would best understand its interest from a share in the management of them . *stop*
The importance of commerce , in the view of revenue alone , must effectually guard it against the enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor , by the urgent calls of public necessity . *stop*
I the rather consult brevity in discussing the probability of a preference founded upon a discrimination between the different kinds of industry and property , because , as far as I understand the meaning of the objectors , they contemplate a discrimination of another kind . *stop*
They appear to have in view , as the objects of the preference with which they endeavor to alarm us , those whom they designate by the description of '' the wealthy and the well-born . '' *stop*
These , it seems , are to be exalted to an odious pre-eminence over the rest of their fellow-citizens . *stop*
At one time , however , their elevation is to be a necessary consequence of the smallness of the representative body ; at another time it is to be effected by depriving the people at large of the opportunity of exercising their right of suffrage in the choice of that body . *stop*
But upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of election to be made , in order to answer the purpose of the meditated preference ? *stop*
Are `` the wealthy and the well-born , '' as they are called , confined to particular spots in the several States ? *stop*
Have they , by some miraculous instinct or foresight , set apart in each of them a common place of residence ? *stop*
Are they only to be met with in the towns or cities ? *stop*
Or are they , on the contrary , scattered over the face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to cast their own lot or that of their predecessors ? *stop*
If the latter is the case , ( as every intelligent man knows it to be , ) is it not evident that the policy of confining the places of election to particular districts would be as subversive of its own aim as it would be exceptionable on every other account ? *stop*
The truth is , that there is no method of securing to the rich the preference apprehended , but by prescribing qualifications of property either for those who may elect or be elected . *stop*
But this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government . *stop*
Its authority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the TIMES , the PLACES , the MANNER of elections . *stop*
The qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen , as has been remarked upon other occasions , are defined and fixed in the Constitution , and are unalterable by the legislature . *stop*
Let it , however , be admitted , for argument sake , that the expedient suggested might be successful ; and let it at the same time be equally taken for granted that all the scruples which a sense of duty or an apprehension of the danger of the experiment might inspire , were overcome in the breasts of the national rulers , still I imagine it will hardly be pretended that they could ever hope to carry such an enterprise into execution without the aid of a military force sufficient to subdue the resistance of the great body of the people . *stop*
The improbability of the existence of a force equal to that object has been discussed and demonstrated in different parts of these papers ; but that the futility of the objection under consideration may appear in the strongest light , it shall be conceded for a moment that such a force might exist , and the national government shall be supposed to be in the actual possession of it . *stop*
What will be the conclusion ? *stop*
With a disposition to invade the essential rights of the community , and with the means of gratifying that disposition , is it presumable that the persons who were actuated by it would amuse themselves in the ridiculous task of fabricating election laws for securing a preference to a favorite class of men ? *stop*
Would they not be likely to prefer a conduct better adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement ? *stop*
Would they not rather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by one decisive act of usurpation , than to trust to precarious expedients which , in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them , might terminate in the dismission , disgrace , and ruin of their authors ? *stop*
Would they not fear that citizens , not less tenacious than conscious of their rights , would flock from the remote extremes of their respective States to the places of election , to overthrow their tyrants , and to substitute men who would be disposed to avenge the violated majesty of the people ? *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
61 The Same Subject Continued ( Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of Members ) From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , February 26 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections , contained in the plan of the convention , when pressed in argument , will sometimes concede the propriety of that provision ; with this qualification , however , that it ought to have been accompanied with a declaration , that all elections should be had in the counties where the electors resided . *stop*
This , say they , was a necessary precaution against an abuse of the power . *stop*
A declaration of this nature would certainly have been harmless ; so far as it would have had the effect of quieting apprehensions , it might not have been undesirable . *stop*
But it would , in fact , have afforded little or no additional security against the danger apprehended ; and the want of it will never be considered , by an impartial and judicious examiner , as a serious , still less as an insuperable , objection to the plan . *stop*
The different views taken of the subject in the two preceding papers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate and discerning men , that if the public liberty should ever be the victim of the ambition of the national rulers , the power under examination , at least , will be guiltless of the sacrifice . *stop*
If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only , would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions , they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm , from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections , than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect . *stop*
A review of their situation , in this particular , would tend greatly to remove any ill impressions which may remain in regard to this matter . *stop*
But as that view would lead into long and tedious details , I shall content myself with the single example of the State in which I write . *stop*
The constitution of New York makes no other provision for LOCALITY of elections , than that the members of the Assembly shall be elected in the COUNTIES ; those of the Senate , in the great districts into which the State is or may be divided : these at present are four in number , and comprehend each from two to six counties . *stop*
It may readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the legislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of New York , by confining elections to particular places , than for the legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of the Union , by the like expedient . *stop*
Suppose , for instance , the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of election for the county and district of which it is a part , would not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors of the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and district ? *stop*
Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote subdivisions of the counties of Albany , Saratoga , Cambridge , etc. , or in any part of the county of Montgomery , would take the trouble to come to the city of Albany , to give their votes for members of the Assembly or Senate , sooner than they would repair to the city of New York , to participate in the choice of the members of the federal House of Representatives ? *stop*
The alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws , which afford every facility to it , furnishes a ready answer to this question . *stop*
And , abstracted from any experience on the subject , we can be at no loss to determine , that when the place of election is at an INCONVENIENT DISTANCE from the elector , the effect upon his conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or twenty thousand miles . *stop*
Hence it must appear , that objections to the particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will , in substance , apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the constitution of this State ; and for this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one , and to condemn the other . *stop*
A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in respect to the constitutions of most of the other States . *stop*
If it should be said that defects in the State constitutions furnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan proposed , I answer , that as the former have never been thought chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty , where the imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to them also , the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling refinements of a predetermined opposition , than the well-founded inferences of a candid research after truth . *stop*
To those who are disposed to consider , as innocent omissions in the State constitutions , what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the plan of the convention , nothing can be said ; or at most , they can only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the representatives of the people in a single State should be more impregnable to the lust of power , or other sinister motives , than the representatives of the people of the United States ? *stop*
If they can not do this , they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier to subvert the liberties of three millions of people , with the advantage of local governments to head their opposition , than of two hundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage . *stop*
And in relation to the point immediately under consideration , they ought to convince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a single State should , in order to maintain its superiority , incline to a preference of a particular class of electors , than that a similar spirit should take possession of the representatives of thirteen States , spread over a vast region , and in several respects distinguishable from each other by a diversity of local circumstances , prejudices , and interests . *stop*
Hitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the provision in question , on the ground of theoretic propriety , on that of the danger of placing the power elsewhere , and on that of the safety of placing it in the manner proposed . *stop*
But there remains to be mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this disposition , and which could not as well have been obtained from any other : I allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of elections for the federal House of Representatives . *stop*
It is more than possible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of great importance to the public welfare , both as a security against the perpetuation of the same spirit in the body , and as a cure for the diseases of faction . *stop*
If each State may choose its own time of election , it is possible there may be at least as many different periods as there are months in the year . *stop*
The times of election in the several States , as they are now established for local purposes , vary between extremes as wide as March and November . *stop*
The consequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time . *stop*
If an improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it , that spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members , as they come forward in succession . *stop*
The mass would be likely to remain nearly the same , assimilating constantly to itself its gradual accretions . *stop*
There is a contagion in example which few men have sufficient force of mind to resist . *stop*
I am inclined to think that treble the duration in office , with the condition of a total dissolution of the body at the same time , might be less formidable to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and successive alterations . *stop*
Uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the Senate , and for conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each year . *stop*
It may be asked , Why , then , could not a time have been fixed in the Constitution ? *stop*
As the most zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention in this State are , in general , not less zealous admirers of the constitution of the State , the question may be retorted , and it may be asked , Why was not a time for the like purpose fixed in the constitution of this State ? *stop*
No better answer can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be entrusted to legislative discretion ; and that if a time had been appointed , it might , upon experiment , have been found less convenient than some other time . *stop*
The same answer may be given to the question put on the other side . *stop*
And it may be added that the supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative , it would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish , as a fundamental point , what would deprive several States of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government at the same epochs . *stop*

65 The Powers of the Senate Continued From the New York Packet . *stop*
Friday , March 7 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to the Senate , in a distinct capacity , are comprised in their participation with the executive in the appointment to offices , and in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments . *stop*
As in the business of appointments the executive will be the principal agent , the provisions relating to it will most properly be discussed in the examination of that department . *stop*
We will , therefore , conclude this head with a view of the judicial character of the Senate . *stop*
A well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective . *stop*
The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men , or , in other words , from the abuse or violation of some public trust . *stop*
They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL , as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself . *stop*
The prosecution of them , for this reason , will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community , and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused . *stop*
In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions , and will enlist all their animosities , partialities , influence , and interest on one side or on the other ; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties , than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt . *stop*
The delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns the political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the administration of public affairs , speak for themselves . *stop*
The difficulty of placing it rightly , in a government resting entirely on the basis of periodical elections , will as readily be perceived , when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it will , from that circumstance , be too often the leaders or the tools of the most cunning or the most numerous faction , and on this account , can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality towards those whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny . *stop*
The convention , it appears , thought the Senate the most fit depositary of this important trust . *stop*
Those who can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing , will be least hasty in condemning that opinion , and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be supposed to have produced it . *stop*
What , it may be asked , is the true spirit of the institution itself ? *stop*
Is it not designed as a method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of public men ? *stop*
If this be the design of it , who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves ? *stop*
It is not disputed that the power of originating the inquiry , or , in other words , of preferring the impeachment , ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the legislative body . *stop*
Will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry ? *stop*
The model from which the idea of this institution has been borrowed , pointed out that course to the convention . *stop*
In Great Britain it is the province of the House of Commons to prefer the impeachment , and of the House of Lords to decide upon it . *stop*
Several of the State constitutions have followed the example . *stop*
As well the latter , as the former , seem to have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the government . *stop*
Is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded ? *stop*
Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified , or sufficiently independent ? *stop*
What other body would be likely to feel CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN ITS OWN SITUATION , to preserve , unawed and uninfluenced , the necessary impartiality between an INDIVIDUAL accused , and the REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE , HIS ACCUSERS ? *stop*
Could the Supreme Court have been relied upon as answering this description ? *stop*
It is much to be doubted , whether the members of that tribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of fortitude , as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a task ; and it is still more to be doubted , whether they would possess the degree of credit and authority , which might , on certain occasions , be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate representatives . *stop*
A deficiency in the first , would be fatal to the accused ; in the last , dangerous to the public tranquillity . *stop*
The hazard in both these respects , could only be avoided , if at all , by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would consist with a reasonable attention to economy . *stop*
The necessity of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments , is equally dictated by the nature of the proceeding . *stop*
This can never be tied down by such strict rules , either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors , or in the construction of it by the judges , as in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security . *stop*
There will be no jury to stand between the judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law , and the party who is to receive or suffer it . *stop*
The awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily have , to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community , forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons . *stop*
These considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a conclusion , that the Supreme Court would have been an improper substitute for the Senate , as a court of impeachments . *stop*
There remains a further consideration , which will not a little strengthen this conclusion . *stop*
It is this : The punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon impeachment , is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender . *stop*
After having been sentenced to a perpetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence , and honors and emoluments of his country , he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law . *stop*
Would it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his fame , and his most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial , should , in another trial , for the same offense , be also the disposers of his life and his fortune ? *stop*
Would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend , that error , in the first sentence , would be the parent of error in the second sentence ? *stop*
That the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision ? *stop*
Those who know anything of human nature , will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative ; and will be at no loss to perceive , that by making the same persons judges in both cases , those who might happen to be the objects of prosecution would , in a great measure , be deprived of the double security intended them by a double trial . *stop*
The loss of life and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which , in its terms , imported nothing more than dismission from a present , and disqualification for a future , office . *stop*
It may be said , that the intervention of a jury , in the second instance , would obviate the danger . *stop*
But juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of judges . *stop*
They are sometimes induced to find special verdicts , which refer the main question to the decision of the court . *stop*
Who would be willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt ? *stop*
Would it have been an improvement of the plan , to have united the Supreme Court with the Senate , in the formation of the court of impeachments ? *stop*
This union would certainly have been attended with several advantages ; but would they not have been overbalanced by the signal disadvantage , already stated , arising from the agency of the same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender would be liable ? *stop*
To a certain extent , the benefits of that union will be obtained from making the chief justice of the Supreme Court the president of the court of impeachments , as is proposed to be done in the plan of the convention ; while the inconveniences of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be substantially avoided . *stop*
This was perhaps the prudent mean . *stop*
I forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the judiciary , which so considerable an augmentation of its authority would have afforded . *stop*
Would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of impeachments , of persons wholly distinct from the other departments of the government ? *stop*
There are weighty arguments , as well against , as in favor of , such a plan . *stop*
To some minds it will not appear a trivial objection , that it could tend to increase the complexity of the political machine , and to add a new spring to the government , the utility of which would at best be questionable . *stop*
But an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention , is this : a court formed upon such a plan , would either be attended with a heavy expense , or might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and inconveniences . *stop*
It must either consist of permanent officers , stationary at the seat of government , and of course entitled to fixed and regular stipends , or of certain officers of the State governments to be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending . *stop*
It will not be easy to imagine any third mode materially different , which could rationally be proposed . *stop*
As the court , for reasons already given , ought to be numerous , the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying them . *stop*
The second will be espoused with caution by those who will seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over the whole Union ; the injury to the innocent , from the procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought against them ; the advantage to the guilty , from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption ; and in some cases the detriment to the State , from the prolonged inaction of men whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in the House of Representatives . *stop*
Though this latter supposition may seem harsh , and might not be likely often to be verified , yet it ought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction will , at certain seasons , extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men . *stop*
But though one or the other of the substitutes which have been examined , or some other that might be devised , should be thought preferable to the plan in this respect , reported by the convention , it will not follow that the Constitution ought for this reason to be rejected . *stop*
If mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of government , until every part of it had been adjusted to the most exact standard of perfection , society would soon become a general scene of anarchy , and the world a desert . *stop*
Where is the standard of perfection to be found ? *stop*
Who will undertake to unite the discordant opinions of a whole community , in the same judgment of it ; and to prevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his INFALLIBLE criterion for the FALLIBLE criterion of his more CONCEITED NEIGHBOR ? *stop*
To answer the purpose of the adversaries of the Constitution , they ought to prove , not merely that particular provisions in it are not the best which might have been imagined , but that the plan upon the whole is bad and pernicious . *stop*

66 Objections to the Power of the Senate To Set as a Court for Impeachments Further Considered . *stop*
From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , March 8 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : A REVIEW of the principal objections that have appeared against the proposed court for the trial of impeachments , will not improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions which may still exist in regard to this matter . *stop*
The FIRST of these objections is , that the provision in question confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body , in violation of that important and well-established maxim which requires a separation between the different departments of power . *stop*
The true meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another place , and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of those departments for special purposes , preserving them , in the main , distinct and unconnected . *stop*
This partial intermixture is even , in some cases , not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense of the several members of the government against each other . *stop*
An absolute or qualified negative in the executive upon the acts of the legislative body , is admitted , by the ablest adepts in political science , to be an indispensable barrier against the encroachments of the latter upon the former . *stop*
And it may , perhaps , with no less reason be contended , that the powers relating to impeachments are , as before intimated , an essential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive . *stop*
The division of them between the two branches of the legislature , assigning to one the right of accusing , to the other the right of judging , avoids the inconvenience of making the same persons both accusers and judges ; and guards against the danger of persecution , from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of those branches . *stop*
As the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate will be requisite to a condemnation , the security to innocence , from this additional circumstance , will be as complete as itself can desire . *stop*
It is curious to observe , with what vehemence this part of the plan is assailed , on the principle here taken notice of , by men who profess to admire , without exception , the constitution of this State ; while that constitution makes the Senate , together with the chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court , not only a court of impeachments , but the highest judicatory in the State , in all causes , civil and criminal . *stop*
The proportion , in point of numbers , of the chancellor and judges to the senators , is so inconsiderable , that the judiciary authority of New York , in the last resort , may , with truth , be said to reside in its Senate . *stop*
If the plan of the convention be , in this respect , chargeable with a departure from the celebrated maxim which has been so often mentioned , and seems to be so little understood , how much more culpable must be the constitution of New York ? *stop*
A SECOND objection to the Senate , as a court of impeachments , is , that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that body , tending to give to the government a countenance too aristocratic . *stop*
The Senate , it is observed , is to have concurrent authority with the Executive in the formation of treaties and in the appointment to offices : if , say the objectors , to these prerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of impeachment , it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial influence . *stop*
To an objection so little precise in itself , it is not easy to find a very precise answer . *stop*
Where is the measure or criterion to which we can appeal , for determining what will give the Senate too much , too little , or barely the proper degree of influence ? *stop*
Will it not be more safe , as well as more simple , to dismiss such vague and uncertain calculations , to examine each power by itself , and to decide , on general principles , where it may be deposited with most advantage and least inconvenience ? *stop*
If we take this course , it will lead to a more intelligible , if not to a more certain result . *stop*
The disposition of the power of making treaties , which has obtained in the plan of the convention , will , then , if I mistake not , appear to be fully justified by the considerations stated in a former number , and by others which will occur under the next head of our inquiries . *stop*
The expediency of the junction of the Senate with the Executive , in the power of appointing to offices , will , I trust , be placed in a light not less satisfactory , in the disquisitions under the same head . *stop*
And I flatter myself the observations in my last paper must have gone no inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy , if practicable , to find a more fit receptacle for the power of determining impeachments , than that which has been chosen . *stop*
If this be truly the case , the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of the Senate ought to be discarded from our reasonings . *stop*
But this hypothesis , such as it is , has already been refuted in the remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the senators . *stop*
It was by them shown , as well on the credit of historical examples , as from the reason of the thing , that the most POPULAR branch of every government , partaking of the republican genius , by being generally the favorite of the people , will be as generally a full match , if not an overmatch , for every other member of the Government . *stop*
But independent of this most active and operative principle , to secure the equilibrium of the national House of Representatives , the plan of the convention has provided in its favor several important counterpoises to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the Senate . *stop*
The exclusive privilege of originating money bills will belong to the House of Representatives . *stop*
The same house will possess the sole right of instituting impeachments : is not this a complete counterbalance to that of determining them ? *stop*
The same house will be the umpire in all elections of the President , which do not unite the suffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors ; a case which it can not be doubted will sometimes , if not frequently , happen . *stop*
The constant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of influence to that body . *stop*
The more it is contemplated , the more important will appear this ultimate though contingent power , of deciding the competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the Union , for the first office in it . *stop*
It would not perhaps be rash to predict , that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh all the peculiar attributes of the Senate . *stop*
A THIRD objection to the Senate as a court of impeachments , is drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office . *stop*
It is imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the conduct of men , in whose official creation they had participated . *stop*
The principle of this objection would condemn a practice , which is to be seen in all the State governments , if not in all the governments with which we are acquainted : I mean that of rendering those who hold offices during pleasure , dependent on the pleasure of those who appoint them . *stop*
With equal plausibility might it be alleged in this case , that the favoritism of the latter would always be an asylum for the misbehavior of the former . *stop*
But that practice , in contradiction to this principle , proceeds upon the presumption , that the responsibility of those who appoint , for the fitness and competency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice , and the interest they will have in the respectable and prosperous administration of affairs , will inspire a sufficient disposition to dismiss from a share in it all such who , by their conduct , shall have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them . *stop*
Though facts may not always correspond with this presumption , yet if it be , in the main , just , it must destroy the supposition that the Senate , who will merely sanction the choice of the Executive , should feel a bias , towards the objects of that choice , strong enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary , as to have induced the representatives of the nation to become its accusers . *stop*
If any further arguments were necessary to evince the improbability of such a bias , it might be found in the nature of the agency of the Senate in the business of appointments . *stop*
It will be the office of the President to NOMINATE , and , with the advice and consent of the Senate , to APPOINT . *stop*
There will , of course , be no exertion of CHOICE on the part of the Senate . *stop*
They may defeat one choice of the Executive , and oblige him to make another ; but they can not themselves CHOOSE -- they can only ratify or reject the choice of the President . *stop*
They might even entertain a preference to some other person , at the very moment they were assenting to the one proposed , because there might be no positive ground of opposition to him ; and they could not be sure , if they withheld their assent , that the subsequent nomination would fall upon their own favorite , or upon any other person in their estimation more meritorious than the one rejected . *stop*
Thus it could hardly happen , that the majority of the Senate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the appearances of merit might inspire , and the proofs of the want of it destroy . *stop*
A FOURTH objection to the Senate in the capacity of a court of impeachments , is derived from its union with the Executive in the power of making treaties . *stop*
This , it has been said , would constitute the senators their own judges , in every case of a corrupt or perfidious execution of that trust . *stop*
After having combined with the Executive in betraying the interests of the nation in a ruinous treaty , what prospect , it is asked , would there be of their being made to suffer the punishment they would deserve , when they were themselves to decide upon the accusation brought against them for the treachery of which they have been guilty ? *stop*
This objection has been circulated with more earnestness and with greater show of reason than any other which has appeared against this part of the plan ; and yet I am deceived if it does not rest upon an erroneous foundation . *stop*
The security essentially intended by the Constitution against corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties , is to be sought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to make them . *stop*
The JOINT AGENCY of the Chief Magistrate of the Union , and of two thirds of the members of a body selected by the collective wisdom of the legislatures of the several States , is designed to be the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this particular . *stop*
The convention might with propriety have meditated the punishment of the Executive , for a deviation from the instructions of the Senate , or a want of integrity in the conduct of the negotiations committed to him ; they might also have had in view the punishment of a few leading individuals in the Senate , who should have prostituted their influence in that body as the mercenary instruments of foreign corruption : but they could not , with more or with equal propriety , have contemplated the impeachment and punishment of two thirds of the Senate , consenting to an improper treaty , than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the national legislature , consenting to a pernicious or unconstitutional law -- a principle which , I believe , has never been admitted into any government . *stop*
How , in fact , could a majority in the House of Representatives impeach themselves ? *stop*
Not better , it is evident , than two thirds of the Senate might try themselves . *stop*
And yet what reason is there , that a majority of the House of Representatives , sacrificing the interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical act of legislation , should escape with impunity , more than two thirds of the Senate , sacrificing the same interests in an injurious treaty with a foreign power ? *stop*
The truth is , that in all such cases it is essential to the freedom and to the necessary independence of the deliberations of the body , that the members of it should be exempt from punishment for acts done in a collective capacity ; and the security to the society must depend on the care which is taken to confide the trust to proper hands , to make it their interest to execute it with fidelity , and to make it as difficult as possible for them to combine in any interest opposite to that of the public good . *stop*
So far as might concern the misbehavior of the Executive in perverting the instructions or contravening the views of the Senate , we need not be apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that body to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their own authority . *stop*
We may thus far count upon their pride , if not upon their virtue . *stop*
And so far even as might concern the corruption of leading members , by whose arts and influence the majority may have been inveigled into measures odious to the community , if the proofs of that corruption should be satisfactory , the usual propensity of human nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be commonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public resentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of their mismanagement and disgrace . *stop*

67 The Executive Department From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , March 11 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE constitution of the executive department of the proposed government , claims next our attention . *stop*
There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this ; and there is , perhaps , none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment . *stop*
Here the writers against the Constitution seem to have taken pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation . *stop*
Calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy , they have endeavored to enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the intended President of the United States ; not merely as the embryo , but as the full-grown progeny , of that detested parent . *stop*
To establish the pretended affinity , they have not scrupled to draw resources even from the regions of fiction . *stop*
The authorities of a magistrate , in few instances greater , in some instances less , than those of a governor of New York , have been magnified into more than royal prerogatives . *stop*
He has been decorated with attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of a king of Great Britain . *stop*
He has been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the imperial purple flowing in his train . *stop*
He has been seated on a throne surrounded with minions and mistresses , giving audience to the envoys of foreign potentates , in all the supercilious pomp of majesty . *stop*
The images of Asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene . *stop*
We have been taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries , and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio . *stop*
Attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or , it might rather be said , to metamorphose the object , render it necessary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form : in order as well to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance , as to unmask the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit resemblances which have been so insidiously , as well as industriously , propagated . *stop*
In the execution of this task , there is no man who would not find it an arduous effort either to behold with moderation , or to treat with seriousness , the devices , not less weak than wicked , which have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the subject . *stop*
They so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable licenses of party artifice , that even in a disposition the most candid and tolerant , they must force the sentiments which favor an indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to give place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation . *stop*
It is impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of Great Britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that of the President of the United States . *stop*
It is still more impossible to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition . *stop*
In one instance , which I cite as a sample of the general spirit , the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the President of the United States a power which by the instrument reported is EXPRESSLY allotted to the Executives of the individual States . *stop*
I mean the power of filling casual vacancies in the Senate . *stop*
This bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has been hazarded by a writer who ( whatever may be his real merit ) has had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party ; and who , upon this false and unfounded suggestion , has built a series of observations equally false and unfounded . *stop*
Let him now be confronted with the evidence of the fact , and let him , if he be able , justify or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing . *stop*
The second clause of the second section of the second article empowers the President of the United States `` to nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other OFFICERS of United States whose appointments are NOT in the Constitution OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR , and WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW . '' *stop*
Immediately after this clause follows another in these words : `` The President shall have power to fill up all VACANCIES that may happen DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE , by granting commissions which shall EXPIRE AT THE END OF THEIR NEXT SESSION . '' *stop*
It is from this last provision that the pretended power of the President to fill vacancies in the Senate has been deduced . *stop*
A slight attention to the connection of the clauses , and to the obvious meaning of the terms , will satisfy us that the deduction is not even colorable . *stop*
The first of these two clauses , it is clear , only provides a mode for appointing such officers , `` whose appointments are NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution , and which SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW '' ; of course it can not extend to the appointments of senators , whose appointments are OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR in the Constitution , and who are ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION , and will not require a future establishment by law . *stop*
This position will hardly be contested . *stop*
The last of these two clauses , it is equally clear , can not be understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the Senate , for the following reasons : First . *stop*
The relation in which that clause stands to the other , which declares the general mode of appointing officers of the United States , denotes it to be nothing more than a supplement to the other , for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of appointment , in cases to which the general method was inadequate . *stop*
The ordinary power of appointment is confined to the President and Senate JOINTLY , and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the Senate ; but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might happen IN THEIR RECESS , which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay , the succeeding clause is evidently intended to authorize the President , SINGLY , to make temporary appointments `` during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . '' *stop*
Second . *stop*
If this clause is to be considered as supplementary to the one which precedes , the VACANCIES of which it speaks must be construed to relate to the '' officers '' described in the preceding one ; and this , we have seen , excludes from its description the members of the Senate . *stop*
Third . *stop*
The time within which the power is to operate , `` during the recess of the Senate , '' and the duration of the appointments , `` to the end of the next session '' of that body , conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision , which , if it had been intended to comprehend senators , would naturally have referred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of the State legislatures , who are to make the permanent appointments , and not to the recess of the national Senate , who are to have no concern in those appointments ; and would have extended the duration in office of the temporary senators to the next session of the legislature of the State , in whose representation the vacancies had happened , instead of making it to expire at the end of the ensuing session of the national Senate . *stop*
The circumstances of the body authorized to make the permanent appointments would , of course , have governed the modification of a power which related to the temporary appointments ; and as the national Senate is the body , whose situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the suggestion under examination has been founded , the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the President . *stop*
But last , the first and second clauses of the third section of the first article , not only obviate all possibility of doubt , but destroy the pretext of misconception . *stop*
The former provides , that `` the Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State , chosen BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF for six years '' ; and the latter directs , that , '' if vacancies in that body should happen by resignation or otherwise , DURING THE RECESS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE , the Executive THEREOF may make temporary appointments until the NEXT MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE , which shall then fill such vacancies . '' *stop*
Here is an express power given , in clear and unambiguous terms , to the State Executives , to fill casual vacancies in the Senate , by temporary appointments ; which not only invalidates the supposition , that the clause before considered could have been intended to confer that power upon the President of the United States , but proves that this supposition , destitute as it is even of the merit of plausibility , must have originated in an intention to deceive the people , too palpable to be obscured by sophistry , too atrocious to be palliated by hypocrisy . *stop*
I have taken the pains to select this instance of misrepresentation , and to place it in a clear and strong light , as an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the Constitution submitted to the consideration of the people . *stop*
Nor have I scrupled , in so flagrant a case , to allow myself a severity of animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these papers . *stop*
I hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid and honest adversary of the proposed government , whether language can furnish epithets of too much asperity , for so shameless and so prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of America . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
68 The Mode of Electing the President From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , March 12 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States is almost the only part of the system , of any consequence , which has escaped without severe censure , or which has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents . *stop*
The most plausible of these , who has appeared in print , has even deigned to admit that the election of the President is pretty well guarded . *stop*
I venture somewhat further , and hesitate not to affirm , that if the manner of it be not perfect , it is at least excellent . *stop*
It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages , the union of which was to be wished for . *stop*
It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided . *stop*
This end will be answered by committing the right of making it , not to any preestablished body , but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose , and at the particular conjuncture . *stop*
It was equally desirable , that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station , and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation , and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice . *stop*
A small number of persons , selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass , will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations . *stop*
It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder . *stop*
This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate , who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States . *stop*
But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration , promise an effectual security against this mischief . *stop*
The choice of SEVERAL , to form an intermediate body of electors , will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements , than the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes . *stop*
And as the electors , chosen in each State , are to assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen , this detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments , which might be communicated from them to the people , than if they were all to be convened at one time , in one place . *stop*
Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal , intrigue , and corruption . *stop*
These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter , but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils . *stop*
How could they better gratify this , than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union ? *stop*
But the convention have guarded against all danger of this sort , with the most provident and judicious attention . *stop*
They have not made the appointment of the President to depend on any preexisting bodies of men , who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes ; but they have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of America , to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment . *stop*
And they have excluded from eligibility to this trust , all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the President in office . *stop*
No senator , representative , or other person holding a place of trust or profit under the United States , can be of the numbers of the electors . *stop*
Thus without corrupting the body of the people , the immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias . *stop*
Their transient existence , and their detached situation , already taken notice of , afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so , to the conclusion of it . *stop*
The business of corruption , when it is to embrace so considerable a number of men , requires time as well as means . *stop*
Nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark them , dispersed as they would be over thirteen States , in any combinations founded upon motives , which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt , might yet be of a nature to mislead them from their duty . *stop*
Another and no less important desideratum was , that the Executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all but the people themselves . *stop*
He might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was necessary to the duration of his official consequence . *stop*
This advantage will also be secured , by making his re-election to depend on a special body of representatives , deputed by the society for the single purpose of making the important choice . *stop*
All these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the convention ; which is , that the people of each State shall choose a number of persons as electors , equal to the number of senators and representatives of such State in the national government , who shall assemble within the State , and vote for some fit person as President . *stop*
Their votes , thus given , are to be transmitted to the seat of the national government , and the person who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the President . *stop*
But as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre in one man , and as it might be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive , it is provided that , in such a contingency , the House of Representatives shall select out of the candidates who shall have the five highest number of votes , the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office . *stop*
The process of election affords a moral certainty , that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications . *stop*
Talents for low intrigue , and the little arts of popularity , may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State ; but it will require other talents , and a different kind of merit , to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole Union , or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States . *stop*
It will not be too strong to say , that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue . *stop*
And this will be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the Constitution , by those who are able to estimate the share which the executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or ill administration . *stop*
Though we can not acquiesce in the political heresy of the poet who says : '' For forms of government let fools contest -- That which is best administered is best , '' -- yet we may safely pronounce , that the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration . *stop*
The Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner with the President ; with this difference , that the Senate is to do , in respect to the former , what is to be done by the House of Representatives , in respect to the latter . *stop*
The appointment of an extraordinary person , as Vice-President , has been objected to as superfluous , if not mischievous . *stop*
It has been alleged , that it would have been preferable to have authorized the Senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that description . *stop*
But two considerations seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this respect . *stop*
One is , that to secure at all times the possibility of a definite resolution of the body , it is necessary that the President should have only a casting vote . *stop*
And to take the senator of any State from his seat as senator , to place him in that of President of the Senate , would be to exchange , in regard to the State from which he came , a constant for a contingent vote . *stop*
The other consideration is , that as the Vice-President may occasionally become a substitute for the President , in the supreme executive magistracy , all the reasons which recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one , apply with great if not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other . *stop*
It is remarkable that in this , as in most other instances , the objection which is made would lie against the constitution of this State . *stop*
We have a Lieutenant-Governor , chosen by the people at large , who presides in the Senate , and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor , in casualties similar to those which would authorize the Vice-President to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties of the President . *stop*

69 The Real Character of the Executive From the New York Packet . *stop*
Friday , March 14 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : I PROCEED now to trace the real characters of the proposed Executive , as they are marked out in the plan of the convention . *stop*
This will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the representations which have been made in regard to it . *stop*
The first thing which strikes our attention is , that the executive authority , with few exceptions , is to be vested in a single magistrate . *stop*
This will scarcely , however , be considered as a point upon which any comparison can be grounded ; for if , in this particular , there be a resemblance to the king of Great Britain , there is not less a resemblance to the Grand Seignior , to the khan of Tartary , to the Man of the Seven Mountains , or to the governor of New York . *stop*
That magistrate is to be elected for four years ; and is to be re-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think him worthy of their confidence . *stop*
In these circumstances there is a total dissimilitude between him and a king of Great Britain , who is an hereditary monarch , possessing the crown as a patrimony descendible to his heirs forever ; but there is a close analogy between him and a governor of New York , who is elected for three years , and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission . *stop*
If we consider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a dangerous influence in a single State , than for establishing a like influence throughout the United States , we must conclude that a duration of four years for the Chief Magistrate of the Union is a degree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office , than a duration of three years for a corresponding office in a single State . *stop*
The President of the United States would be liable to be impeached , tried , and , upon conviction of treason , bribery , or other high crimes or misdemeanors , removed from office ; and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law . *stop*
The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable ; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable ; no punishment to which he can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national revolution . *stop*
In this delicate and important circumstance of personal responsibility , the President of Confederated America would stand upon no better ground than a governor of New York , and upon worse ground than the governors of Maryland and Delaware . *stop*
The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill , which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature , for reconsideration ; and the bill so returned is to become a law , if , upon that reconsideration , it be approved by two thirds of both houses . *stop*
The king of Great Britain , on his part , has an absolute negative upon the acts of the two houses of Parliament . *stop*
The disuse of that power for a considerable time past does not affect the reality of its existence ; and is to be ascribed wholly to the crown 's having found the means of substituting influence to authority , or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of the two houses , to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national agitation . *stop*
The qualified negative of the President differs widely from this absolute negative of the British sovereign ; and tallies exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of this State , of which the governor is a constituent part . *stop*
In this respect the power of the President would exceed that of the governor of New York , because the former would possess , singly , what the latter shares with the chancellor and judges ; but it would be precisely the same with that of the governor of Massachusetts , whose constitution , as to this article , seems to have been the original from which the convention have copied . *stop*
The President is to be the `` commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several States , when called into the actual service of the United States . *stop*
He is to have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment ; to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient ; to convene , on extraordinary occasions , both houses of the legislature , or either of them , and , in case of disagreement between them with respect to the time of adjournment , to adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper ; to take care that the laws be faithfully executed ; and to commission all officers of the United States . '' *stop*
In most of these particulars , the power of the President will resemble equally that of the king of Great Britain and of the governor of New York . *stop*
The most material points of difference are these : -- First . *stop*
The President will have only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the Union . *stop*
The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have at all times the entire command of all the militia within their several jurisdictions . *stop*
In this article , therefore , the power of the President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor . *stop*
Second . *stop*
The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States . *stop*
In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain , but in substance much inferior to it . *stop*
It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces , as first General and admiral of the Confederacy ; while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies -- all which , by the Constitution under consideration , would appertain to the legislature . *stop*
The governor of New York , on the other hand , is by the constitution of the State vested only with the command of its militia and navy . *stop*
But the constitutions of several of the States expressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief , as well of the army as navy ; and it may well be a question , whether those of New Hampshire and Massachusetts , in particular , do not , in this instance , confer larger powers upon their respective governors , than could be claimed by a President of the United States . *stop*
Third . *stop*
The power of the President , in respect to pardons , would extend to all cases , except those of impeachment . *stop*
The governor of New York may pardon in all cases , even in those of impeachment , except for treason and murder . *stop*
Is not the power of the governor , in this article , on a calculation of political consequences , greater than that of the President ? *stop*
All conspiracies and plots against the government , which have not been matured into actual treason , may be screened from punishment of every kind , by the interposition of the prerogative of pardoning . *stop*
If a governor of New York , therefore , should be at the head of any such conspiracy , until the design had been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices and adherents an entire impunity . *stop*
A President of the Union , on the other hand , though he may even pardon treason , when prosecuted in the ordinary course of law , could shelter no offender , in any degree , from the effects of impeachment and conviction . *stop*
Would not the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise against the public liberty , than the mere prospect of an exemption from death and confiscation , if the final execution of the design , upon an actual appeal to arms , should miscarry ? *stop*
Would this last expectation have any influence at all , when the probability was computed , that the person who was to afford that exemption might himself be involved in the consequences of the measure , and might be incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired impunity ? *stop*
The better to judge of this matter , it will be necessary to recollect , that , by the proposed Constitution , the offense of treason is limited `` to levying war upon the United States , and adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort '' ; and that by the laws of New York it is confined within similar bounds . *stop*
Fourth . *stop*
The President can only adjourn the national legislature in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment . *stop*
The British monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the Parliament . *stop*
The governor of New York may also prorogue the legislature of this State for a limited time ; a power which , in certain situations , may be employed to very important purposes . *stop*
The President is to have power , with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the senators present concur . *stop*
The king of Great Britain is the sole and absolute representative of the nation in all foreign transactions . *stop*
He can of his own accord make treaties of peace , commerce , alliance , and of every other description . *stop*
It has been insinuated , that his authority in this respect is not conclusive , and that his conventions with foreign powers are subject to the revision , and stand in need of the ratification , of Parliament . *stop*
But I believe this doctrine was never heard of , until it was broached upon the present occasion . *stop*
Every jurist of that kingdom , and every other man acquainted with its Constitution , knows , as an established fact , that the prerogative of making treaties exists in the crown in its utmost plentitude ; and that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most complete legal validity and perfection , independent of any other sanction . *stop*
The Parliament , it is true , is sometimes seen employing itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the stipulations in a new treaty ; and this may have possibly given birth to the imagination , that its co-operation was necessary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty . *stop*
But this parliamentary interposition proceeds from a different cause : from the necessity of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and commercial laws , to the changes made in them by the operation of the treaty ; and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new state of things , to keep the machine from running into disorder . *stop*
In this respect , therefore , there is no comparison between the intended power of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign . *stop*
The one can perform alone what the other can do only with the concurrence of a branch of the legislature . *stop*
It must be admitted , that , in this instance , the power of the federal Executive would exceed that of any State Executive . *stop*
But this arises naturally from the sovereign power which relates to treaties . *stop*
If the Confederacy were to be dissolved , it would become a question , whether the Executives of the several States were not solely invested with that delicate and important prerogative . *stop*
The President is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors and other public ministers . *stop*
This , though it has been a rich theme of declamation , is more a matter of dignity than of authority . *stop*
It is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the administration of the government ; and it was far more convenient that it should be arranged in this manner , than that there should be a necessity of convening the legislature , or one of its branches , upon every arrival of a foreign minister , though it were merely to take the place of a departed predecessor . *stop*
The President is to nominate , and , with the advice and consent of the Senate , to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers , judges of the Supreme Court , and in general all officers of the United States established by law , and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution . *stop*
The king of Great Britain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor . *stop*
He not only appoints to all offices , but can create offices . *stop*
He can confer titles of nobility at pleasure ; and has the disposal of an immense number of church preferments . *stop*
There is evidently a great inferiority in the power of the President , in this particular , to that of the British king ; nor is it equal to that of the governor of New York , if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution of the State by the practice which has obtained under it . *stop*
The power of appointment is with us lodged in a council , composed of the governor and four members of the Senate , chosen by the Assembly . *stop*
The governor claims , and has frequently exercised , the right of nomination , and is entitled to a casting vote in the appointment . *stop*
If he really has the right of nominating , his authority is in this respect equal to that of the President , and exceeds it in the article of the casting vote . *stop*
In the national government , if the Senate should be divided , no appointment could be made ; in the government of New York , if the council should be divided , the governor can turn the scale , and confirm his own nomination . *stop*
If we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode of appointment by the President and an entire branch of the national legislature , with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the governor of New York , closeted in a secret apartment with at most four , and frequently with only two persons ; and if we at the same time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small number of which a council of appointment consists , than the considerable number of which the national Senate would consist , we can not hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate of this State , in the disposition of offices , must , in practice , be greatly superior to that of the Chief Magistrate of the Union . *stop*
Hence it appears that , except as to the concurrent authority of the President in the article of treaties , it would be difficult to determine whether that magistrate would , in the aggregate , possess more or less power than the Governor of New York . *stop*
And it appears yet more unequivocally , that there is no pretense for the parallel which has been attempted between him and the king of Great Britain . *stop*
But to render the contrast in this respect still more striking , it may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude into a closer group . *stop*
The President of the United States would be an officer elected by the people for four years ; the king of Great Britain is a perpetual and hereditary prince . *stop*
The one would be amenable to personal punishment and disgrace ; the person of the other is sacred and inviolable . *stop*
The one would have a qualified negative upon the acts of the legislative body ; the other has an absolute negative . *stop*
The one would have a right to command the military and naval forces of the nation ; the other , in addition to this right , possesses that of declaring war , and of raising and regulating fleets and armies by his own authority . *stop*
The one would have a concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties ; the other is the sole possessor of the power of making treaties . *stop*
The one would have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices ; the other is the sole author of all appointments . *stop*
The one can confer no privileges whatever ; the other can make denizens of aliens , noblemen of commoners ; can erect corporations with all the rights incident to corporate bodies . *stop*
The one can prescribe no rules concerning the commerce or currency of the nation ; the other is in several respects the arbiter of commerce , and in this capacity can establish markets and fairs , can regulate weights and measures , can lay embargoes for a limited time , can coin money , can authorize or prohibit the circulation of foreign coin . *stop*
The one has no particle of spiritual jurisdiction ; the other is the supreme head and governor of the national church ! *stop*
What answer shall we give to those who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other ? *stop*
The same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a government , the whole power of which would be in the hands of the elective and periodical servants of the people , is an aristocracy , a monarchy , and a despotism . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
70 The Executive Department Further Considered From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Saturday , March 15 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THERE is an idea , which is not without its advocates , that a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government . *stop*
The enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation ; since they can never admit its truth , without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles . *stop*
Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government . *stop*
It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks ; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws ; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice ; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition , of faction , and of anarchy . *stop*
Every man the least conversant in Roman story , knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man , under the formidable title of Dictator , as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny , and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government , as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of Rome . *stop*
There can be no need , however , to multiply arguments or examples on this head . *stop*
A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government . *stop*
A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution ; and a government ill executed , whatever it may be in theory , must be , in practice , a bad government . *stop*
Taking it for granted , therefore , that all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic Executive , it will only remain to inquire , what are the ingredients which constitute this energy ? *stop*
How far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense ? *stop*
And how far does this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by the convention ? *stop*
The ingredients which constitute energy in the Executive are , first , unity ; secondly , duration ; thirdly , an adequate provision for its support ; fourthly , competent powers . *stop*
The ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense are , first , a due dependence on the people , secondly , a due responsibility . *stop*
Those politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views , have declared in favor of a single Executive and a numerous legislature . *stop*
They have with great propriety , considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former , and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand , while they have , with equal propriety , considered the latter as best adapted to deliberation and wisdom , and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their privileges and interests . *stop*
That unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed . *stop*
Decision , activity , secrecy , and despatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number ; and in proportion as the number is increased , these qualities will be diminished . *stop*
This unity may be destroyed in two ways : either by vesting the power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority ; or by vesting it ostensibly in one man , subject , in whole or in part , to the control and co-operation of others , in the capacity of counsellors to him . *stop*
Of the first , the two Consuls of Rome may serve as an example ; of the last , we shall find examples in the constitutions of several of the States . *stop*
New York and New Jersey , if I recollect right , are the only States which have intrusted the executive authority wholly to single men . *stop*
Both these methods of destroying the unity of the Executive have their partisans ; but the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous . *stop*
They are both liable , if not to equal , to similar objections , and may in most lights be examined in conjunction . *stop*
The experience of other nations will afford little instruction on this head . *stop*
As far , however , as it teaches any thing , it teaches us not to be enamoured of plurality in the Executive . *stop*
We have seen that the Achaeans , on an experiment of two Praetors , were induced to abolish one . *stop*
The Roman history records many instances of mischiefs to the republic from the dissensions between the Consuls , and between the military Tribunes , who were at times substituted for the Consuls . *stop*
But it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those magistrates . *stop*
That the dissensions between them were not more frequent or more fatal , is a matter of astonishment , until we advert to the singular position in which the republic was almost continually placed , and to the prudent policy pointed out by the circumstances of the state , and pursued by the Consuls , of making a division of the government between them . *stop*
The patricians engaged in a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of their ancient authorities and dignities ; the Consuls , who were generally chosen out of the former body , were commonly united by the personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their order . *stop*
In addition to this motive of union , after the arms of the republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire , it became an established custom with the Consuls to divide the administration between themselves by lot -- one of them remaining at Rome to govern the city and its environs , the other taking the command in the more distant provinces . *stop*
This expedient must , no doubt , have had great influence in preventing those collisions and rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the republic . *stop*
But quitting the dim light of historical research , attaching ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good sense , we shall discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the Executive , under any modification whatever . *stop*
Wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common enterprise or pursuit , there is always danger of difference of opinion . *stop*
If it be a public trust or office , in which they are clothed with equal dignity and authority , there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even animosity . *stop*
From either , and especially from all these causes , the most bitter dissensions are apt to spring . *stop*
Whenever these happen , they lessen the respectability , weaken the authority , and distract the plans and operation of those whom they divide . *stop*
If they should unfortunately assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country , consisting of a plurality of persons , they might impede or frustrate the most important measures of the government , in the most critical emergencies of the state . *stop*
And what is still worse , they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions , adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the magistracy . *stop*
Men often oppose a thing , merely because they have had no agency in planning it , or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike . *stop*
But if they have been consulted , and have happened to disapprove , opposition then becomes , in their estimation , an indispensable duty of self-love . *stop*
They seem to think themselves bound in honor , and by all the motives of personal infallibility , to defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments . *stop*
Men of upright , benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of remarking , with horror , to what desperate lengths this disposition is sometimes carried , and how often the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity , to the conceit , and to the obstinacy of individuals , who have credit enough to make their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind . *stop*
Perhaps the question now before the public may , in its consequences , afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty , or rather detestable vice , in the human character . *stop*
Upon the principles of a free government , inconveniences from the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation of the legislature ; but it is unnecessary , and therefore unwise , to introduce them into the constitution of the Executive . *stop*
It is here too that they may be most pernicious . *stop*
In the legislature , promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit . *stop*
The differences of opinion , and the jarrings of parties in that department of the government , though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans , yet often promote deliberation and circumspection , and serve to check excesses in the majority . *stop*
When a resolution too is once taken , the opposition must be at an end . *stop*
That resolution is a law , and resistance to it punishable . *stop*
But no favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of dissension in the executive department . *stop*
Here , they are pure and unmixed . *stop*
There is no point at which they cease to operate . *stop*
They serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which they relate , from the first step to the final conclusion of it . *stop*
They constantly counteract those qualities in the Executive which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition -- vigor and expedition , and this without any counterbalancing good . *stop*
In the conduct of war , in which the energy of the Executive is the bulwark of the national security , every thing would be to be apprehended from its plurality . *stop*
It must be confessed that these observations apply with principal weight to the first case supposed -- that is , to a plurality of magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme , the advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect ; but they apply , though not with equal , yet with considerable weight to the project of a council , whose concurrence is made constitutionally necessary to the operations of the ostensible Executive . *stop*
An artful cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the whole system of administration . *stop*
If no such cabal should exist , the mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of habitual feebleness and dilatoriness . *stop*
( But one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the Executive , and which lies as much against the last as the first plan , is , that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility . *stop*
Responsibility is of two kinds -- to censure and to punishment . *stop*
The first is the more important of the two , especially in an elective office . *stop*
Man , in public trust , will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted , than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment . *stop*
But the multiplication of the Executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case . *stop*
It often becomes impossible , amidst mutual accusations , to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure , or series of pernicious measures , ought really to fall . *stop*
It is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity , and under such plausible appearances , that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author . *stop*
The circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that , where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency , though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement , yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable . ) *stop*

`` I was overruled by my council . *stop*
The council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point . '' *stop*
These and similar pretexts are constantly at hand , whether true or false . *stop*
And who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium , of a strict scrutiny into the secret springs of the transaction ? *stop*
Should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task , if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned , how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity , as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties ? *stop*
In the single instance in which the governor of this State is coupled with a council -- that is , in the appointment to offices , we have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration . *stop*
Scandalous appointments to important offices have been made . *stop*
Some cases , indeed , have been so flagrant that ALL PARTIES have agreed in the impropriety of the thing . *stop*
When inquiry has been made , the blame has been laid by the governor on the members of the council , who , on their part , have charged it upon his nomination ; while the people remain altogether at a loss to determine , by whose influence their interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so manifestly improper . *stop*
In tenderness to individuals , I forbear to descend to particulars . *stop*
It is evident from these considerations , that the plurality of the Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power , first , the restraints of public opinion , which lose their efficacy , as well on account of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among a number , as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall ; and , second , the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the persons they trust , in order either to their removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which admit of it . *stop*
In England , the king is a perpetual magistrate ; and it is a maxim which has obtained for the sake of the public peace , that he is unaccountable for his administration , and his person sacred . *stop*
Nothing , therefore , can be wiser in that kingdom , than to annex to the king a constitutional council , who may be responsible to the nation for the advice they give . *stop*
Without this , there would be no responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea inadmissible in a free government . *stop*
But even there the king is not bound by the resolutions of his council , though they are answerable for the advice they give . *stop*
He is the absolute master of his own conduct in the exercise of his office , and may observe or disregard the counsel given to him at his sole discretion . *stop*
But in a republic , where every magistrate ought to be personally responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the British Constitution dictates the propriety of a council , not only ceases to apply , but turns against the institution . *stop*
In the monarchy of Great Britain , it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited responsibility of the chief magistrate , which serves in some degree as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior . *stop*
In the American republic , it would serve to destroy , or would greatly diminish , the intended and necessary responsibility of the Chief Magistrate himself . *stop*
The idea of a council to the Executive , which has so generally obtained in the State constitutions , has been derived from that maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a number of men than of a single man . *stop*
If the maxim should be admitted to be applicable to the case , I should contend that the advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the opposite side . *stop*
But I do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power . *stop*
I clearly concur in opinion , in this particular , with a writer whom the celebrated Junius pronounces to be `` deep , solid , and ingenious , '' that `` the executive power is more easily confined when it is ONE '' ; that it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people ; and , in a word , that all multiplication of the Executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty . *stop*
A little consideration will satisfy us , that the species of security sought for in the multiplication of the Executive , is unattainable . *stop*
Numbers must be so great as to render combination difficult , or they are rather a source of danger than of security . *stop*
The united credit and influence of several individuals must be more formidable to liberty , than the credit and influence of either of them separately . *stop*
When power , therefore , is placed in the hands of so small a number of men , as to admit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common enterprise , by an artful leader , it becomes more liable to abuse , and more dangerous when abused , than if it be lodged in the hands of one man ; who , from the very circumstance of his being alone , will be more narrowly watched and more readily suspected , and who can not unite so great a mass of influence as when he is associated with others . *stop*
The Decemvirs of Rome , whose name denotes their number , were more to be dreaded in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been . *stop*
No person would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that body ; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the council . *stop*
The extreme of these numbers , is not too great for an easy combination ; and from such a combination America would have more to fear , than from the ambition of any single individual . *stop*
A council to a magistrate , who is himself responsible for what he does , are generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions , are often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost always a cloak to his faults . *stop*
I forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense ; though it be evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the principal end aimed at by the institution , the salaries of the members , who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of government , would form an item in the catalogue of public expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal utility . *stop*
I will only add that , prior to the appearance of the Constitution , I rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the States , who did not admit , as the result of experience , that the UNITY of the executive of this State was one of the best of the distinguishing features of our constitution . *stop*

71 The Duration in Office of the Executive From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , March 18 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : DURATION in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to the energy of the Executive authority . *stop*
This has relation to two objects : to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate , in the employment of his constitutional powers ; and to the stability of the system of administration which may have been adopted under his auspices . *stop*
With regard to the first , it must be evident , that the longer the duration in office , the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an advantage . *stop*
It is a general principle of human nature , that a man will be interested in whatever he possesses , in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it ; will be less attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain title , than to what he enjoys by a durable or certain title ; and , of course , will be willing to risk more for the sake of the one , than for the sake of the other . *stop*
This remark is not less applicable to a political privilege , or honor , or trust , than to any article of ordinary property . *stop*
The inference from it is , that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate , under a consciousness that in a very short time he MUST lay down his office , will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any material censure or perplexity , from the independent exertion of his powers , or from encountering the ill-humors , however transient , which may happen to prevail , either in a considerable part of the society itself , or even in a predominant faction in the legislative body . *stop*
If the case should only be , that he MIGHT lay it down , unless continued by a new choice , and if he should be desirous of being continued , his wishes , conspiring with his fears , would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity , or debase his fortitude . *stop*
In either case , feebleness and irresolution must be the characteristics of the station . *stop*
There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of the Executive to a prevailing current , either in the community or in the legislature , as its best recommendation . *stop*
But such men entertain very crude notions , as well of the purposes for which government was instituted , as of the true means by which the public happiness may be promoted . *stop*
The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs ; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion , or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men , who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests . *stop*
It is a just observation , that the people commonly INTEND the PUBLIC GOOD . *stop*
This often applies to their very errors . *stop*
But their good sense would despise the adulator who should pretend that they always REASON RIGHT about the MEANS of promoting it . *stop*
They know from experience that they sometimes err ; and the wonder is that they so seldom err as they do , beset , as they continually are , by the wiles of parasites and sycophants , by the snares of the ambitious , the avaricious , the desperate , by the artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve it , and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it . *stop*
When occasions present themselves , in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations , it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests , to withstand the temporary delusion , in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection . *stop*
Instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes , and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure . *stop*
But however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the Executive to the inclinations of the people , we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the legislature . *stop*
The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the former , and at other times the people may be entirely neutral . *stop*
In either supposition , it is certainly desirable that the Executive should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and decision . *stop*
The same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power , teaches us likewise that this partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the other . *stop*
To what purpose separate the executive or the judiciary from the legislative , if both the executive and the judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of the legislative ? *stop*
Such a separation must be merely nominal , and incapable of producing the ends for which it was established . *stop*
It is one thing to be subordinate to the laws , and another to be dependent on the legislative body . *stop*
The first comports with , the last violates , the fundamental principles of good government ; and , whatever may be the forms of the Constitution , unites all power in the same hands . *stop*
The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every other , has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in some preceding numbers . *stop*
In governments purely republican , this tendency is almost irresistible . *stop*
The representatives of the people , in a popular assembly , seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves , and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter ; as if the exercise of its rights , by either the executive or judiciary , were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity . *stop*
They often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the other departments ; and as they commonly have the people on their side , they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the Constitution . *stop*
It may perhaps be asked , how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature , unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the other . *stop*
One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is , from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage , and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself , on account of it , to any considerable inconvenience or hazard . *stop*
Another answer , perhaps more obvious , though not more conclusive , will result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative body over the people ; which might be employed to prevent the re-election of a man who , by an upright resistance to any sinister project of that body , should have made himself obnoxious to its resentment . *stop*
It may be asked also , whether a duration of four years would answer the end proposed ; and if it would not , whether a less period , which would at least be recommended by greater security against ambitious designs , would not , for that reason , be preferable to a longer period , which was , at the same time , too short for the purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the magistrate . *stop*
It can not be affirmed , that a duration of four years , or any other limited duration , would completely answer the end proposed ; but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material influence upon the spirit and character of the government . *stop*
Between the commencement and termination of such a period , there would always be a considerable interval , in which the prospect of annihilation would be sufficiently remote , not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of fortitude ; and in which he might reasonably promise himself , that there would be time enough before it arrived , to make the community sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue . *stop*
Though it be probable that , as he approached the moment when the public were , by a new election , to signify their sense of his conduct , his confidence , and with it his firmness , would decline ; yet both the one and the other would derive support from the opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had afforded him , of establishing himself in the esteem and good-will of his constituents . *stop*
He might , then , hazard with safety , in proportion to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity , and to the title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his fellow-citizens . *stop*
As , on the one hand , a duration of four years will contribute to the firmness of the Executive in a sufficient degree to render it a very valuable ingredient in the composition ; so , on the other , it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public liberty . *stop*
If a British House of Commons , from the most feeble beginnings , FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX , have , by rapid strides , reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a free government , while they raised themselves to the rank and consequence of a coequal branch of the legislature ; if they have been able , in one instance , to abolish both the royalty and the aristocracy , and to overturn all the ancient establishments , as well in the Church as State ; if they have been able , on a recent occasion , to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an innovation attempted by them , what would be to be feared from an elective magistrate of four years ' duration , with the confined authorities of a President of the United States ? *stop*
What , but that he might be unequal to the task which the Constitution assigns him ? *stop*
I shall only add , that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of his firmness , that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his encroachments . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
72 The Same Subject Continued , and Re-Eligibility of the Executive Considered . *stop*
From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , March 19 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE administration of government , in its largest sense , comprehends all the operations of the body politic , whether legislative , executive , or judiciary ; but in its most usual , and perhaps its most precise signification . *stop*
it is limited to executive details , and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department . *stop*
The actual conduct of foreign negotiations , the preparatory plans of finance , the application and disbursement of the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the legislature , the arrangement of the army and navy , the directions of the operations of war -- these , and other matters of a like nature , constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the administration of government . *stop*
The persons , therefore , to whose immediate management these different matters are committed , ought to be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate , and on this account , they ought to derive their offices from his appointment , at least from his nomination , and ought to be subject to his superintendence . *stop*
This view of the subject will at once suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration . *stop*
To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor , is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert ; and in addition to this propensity , where the alteration has been the result of public choice , the person substituted is warranted in supposing that the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to his measures ; and that the less he resembles him , the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents . *stop*
These considerations , and the influence of personal confidences and attachments , would be likely to induce every new President to promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations ; and these causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous mutability in the administration of the government . *stop*
With a positive duration of considerable extent , I connect the circumstance of re-eligibility . *stop*
The first is necessary to give to the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well , and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of his measures , and thence to form an experimental estimate of their merits . *stop*
The last is necessary to enable the people , when they see reason to approve of his conduct , to continue him in his station , in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues , and to secure to the government the advantage of permanency in a wise system of administration . *stop*
Nothing appears more plausible at first sight , nor more ill-founded upon close inspection , than a scheme which in relation to the present point has had some respectable advocates -- I mean that of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time , and then excluding him from it , either for a limited period or forever after . *stop*
This exclusion , whether temporary or perpetual , would have nearly the same effects , and these effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than salutary . *stop*
One ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior . *stop*
There are few men who would not feel much less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious that the advantages of the station with which it was connected must be relinquished at a determinate period , than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining , by meriting , a continuance of them . *stop*
This position will not be disputed so long as it is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest incentives of human conduct ; or that the best security for the fidelity of mankind is to make their interests coincide with their duty . *stop*
Even the love of fame , the ruling passion of the noblest minds , which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit , requiring considerable time to mature and perfect them , if he could flatter himself with the prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun , would , on the contrary , deter him from the undertaking , when he foresaw that he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work , and must commit that , together with his own reputation , to hands which might be unequal or unfriendly to the task . *stop*
The most to be expected from the generality of men , in such a situation , is the negative merit of not doing harm , instead of the positive merit of doing good . *stop*
Another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to sordid views , to peculation , and , in some instances , to usurpation . *stop*
An avaricious man , who might happen to fill the office , looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed , would feel a propensity , not easy to be resisted by such a man , to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted , and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory ; though the same man , probably , with a different prospect before him , might content himself with the regular perquisites of his situation , and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of an abuse of his opportunities . *stop*
His avarice might be a guard upon his avarice . *stop*
Add to this that the same man might be vain or ambitious , as well as avaricious . *stop*
And if he could expect to prolong his honors by his good conduct , he might hesitate to sacrifice his appetite for them to his appetite for gain . *stop*
But with the prospect before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation , his avarice would be likely to get the victory over his caution , his vanity , or his ambition . *stop*
An ambitious man , too , when he found himself seated on the summit of his country 's honors , when he looked forward to the time at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever , and reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse ; such a man , in such a situation , would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power , at every personal hazard , than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing his duty . *stop*
Would it promote the peace of the community , or the stability of the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy , wandering among the people like discontented ghosts , and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess ? *stop*
A third ill effect of the exclusion would be , the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magistrate in the exercise of his office . *stop*
That experience is the parent of wisdom , is an adage the truth of which is recognized by the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind . *stop*
What more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations ? *stop*
Where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation ? *stop*
Can it be wise to put this desirable and essential quality under the ban of the Constitution , and to declare that the moment it is acquired , its possessor shall be compelled to abandon the station in which it was acquired , and to which it is adapted ? *stop*
This , nevertheless , is the precise import of all those regulations which exclude men from serving their country , by the choice of their fellowcitizens , after they have by a course of service fitted themselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility . *stop*
A fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men from stations in which , in certain emergencies of the state , their presence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or safety . *stop*
There is no nation which has not , at one period or another , experienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men in particular situations ; perhaps it would not be too strong to say , to the preservation of its political existence . *stop*
How unwise , therefore , must be every such self-denying ordinance as serves to prohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens in the manner best suited to its exigencies and circumstances ! *stop*
Without supposing the personal essentiality of the man , it is evident that a change of the chief magistrate , at the breaking out of a war , or at any similar crisis , for another , even of equal merit , would at all times be detrimental to the community , inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience , and would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of the administration . *stop*
A fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be , that it would operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration . *stop*
By necessitating a change of men , in the first office of the nation , it would necessitate a mutability of measures . *stop*
It is not generally to be expected , that men will vary and measures remain uniform . *stop*
The contrary is the usual course of things . *stop*
And we need not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability , while there is even the option of changing ; nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they think it may be safely placed , and where , by constancy on their part , they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy . *stop*
These are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the principle of exclusion . *stop*
They apply most forcibly to the scheme of a perpetual exclusion ; but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious object , the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other . *stop*
What are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages ? *stop*
They are represented to be : 1st , greater independence in the magistrate ; 2d , greater security to the people . *stop*
Unless the exclusion be perpetual , there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage . *stop*
But even in that case , may he have no object beyond his present station , to which he may sacrifice his independence ? *stop*
May he have no connections , no friends , for whom he may sacrifice it ? *stop*
May he not be less willing by a firm conduct , to make personal enemies , when he acts under the impression that a time is fast approaching , on the arrival of which he not only MAY , but MUST , be exposed to their resentments , upon an equal , perhaps upon an inferior , footing ? *stop*
It is not an easy point to determine whether his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an arrangement . *stop*
As to the second supposed advantage , there is still greater reason to entertain doubts concerning it . *stop*
If the exclusion were to be perpetual , a man of irregular ambition , of whom alone there could be reason in any case to entertain apprehension , would , with infinite reluctance , yield to the necessity of taking his leave forever of a post in which his passion for power and pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit . *stop*
And if he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good-will of the people , he might induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint upon themselves , a provision which was calculated to debar them of the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite . *stop*
There may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the people , seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite , might occasion greater danger to liberty , than could ever reasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office , by the voluntary suffrages of the community , exercising a constitutional privilege . *stop*
There is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the people to continue in office men who had entitled themselves , in their opinion , to approbation and confidence ; the advantages of which are at best speculative and equivocal , and are overbalanced by disadvantages far more certain and decisive . *stop*

73 The Provision For The Support of the Executive , and the Veto Power From the New York Packet . *stop*
Friday , March 21 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the executive authority , is an adequate provision for its support . *stop*
It is evident that , without proper attention to this article , the separation of the executive from the legislative department would be merely nominal and nugatory . *stop*
The legislature , with a discretionary power over the salary and emoluments of the Chief Magistrate , could render him as obsequious to their will as they might think proper to make him . *stop*
They might , in most cases , either reduce him by famine , or tempt him by largesses , to surrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations . *stop*
These expressions , taken in all the latitude of the terms , would no doubt convey more than is intended . *stop*
There are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of their duty ; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils ; and in the main it will be found that a power over a man 's support is a power over his will . *stop*
If it were necessary to confirm so plain a truth by facts , examples would not be wanting , even in this country , of the intimidation or seduction of the Executive by the terrors or allurements of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body . *stop*
It is not easy , therefore , to commend too highly the judicious attention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed Constitution . *stop*
It is there provided that `` The President of the United States shall , at stated times , receive for his services a compensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected ; and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States , or any of them . '' *stop*
It is impossible to imagine any provision which would have been more eligible than this . *stop*
The legislature , on the appointment of a President , is once for all to declare what shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which he shall have been elected . *stop*
This done , they will have no power to alter it , either by increase or diminution , till a new period of service by a new election commences . *stop*
They can neither weaken his fortitude by operating on his necessities , nor corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice . *stop*
Neither the Union , nor any of its members , will be at liberty to give , nor will he be at liberty to receive , any other emolument than that which may have been determined by the first act . *stop*
He can , of course , have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by the Constitution . *stop*
The last of the requisites to energy , which have been enumerated , are competent powers . *stop*
Let us proceed to consider those which are proposed to be vested in the President of the United States . *stop*
The first thing that offers itself to our observation , is the qualified negative of the President upon the acts or resolutions of the two houses of the legislature ; or , in other words , his power of returning all bills with objections , to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws , unless they should afterwards be ratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the legislative body . *stop*
The propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights , and to absorb the powers , of the other departments , has been already suggested and repeated ; the insufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each , has also been remarked upon ; and the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own defense , has been inferred and proved . *stop*
From these clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of a negative , either absolute or qualified , in the Executive , upon the acts of the legislative branches . *stop*
Without the one or the other , the former would be absolutely unable to defend himself against the depredations of the latter . *stop*
He might gradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions , or annihilated by a single vote . *stop*
And in the one mode or the other , the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the same hands . *stop*
If even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the legislative body to invade the rights of the Executive , the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us , that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other , but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of self-defense . *stop*
But the power in question has a further use . *stop*
It not only serves as a shield to the Executive , but it furnishes an additional security against the enaction of improper laws . *stop*
It establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body , calculated to guard the community against the effects of faction , precipitancy , or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good , which may happen to influence a majority of that body . *stop*
The propriety of a negative has , upon some occasions , been combated by an observation , that it was not to be presumed a single man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men ; and that unless this presumption should be entertained , it would be improper to give the executive magistrate any species of control over the legislative body . *stop*
But this observation , when examined , will appear rather specious than solid . *stop*
The propriety of the thing does not turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the Executive , but upon the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible ; that the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of other members of the government ; that a spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations ; that impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which itself , on maturer reflexion , would condemn . *stop*
The primary inducement to conferring the power in question upon the Executive is , to enable him to defend himself ; the secondary one is to increase the chances in favor of the community against the passing of bad laws , through haste , inadvertence , or design . *stop*
The oftener the measure is brought under examination , the greater the diversity in the situations of those who are to examine it , the less must be the danger of those errors which flow from want of due deliberation , or of those missteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or interest . *stop*
It is far less probable , that culpable views of any kind should infect all the parts of the government at the same moment and in relation to the same object , than that they should by turns govern and mislead every one of them . *stop*
It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones ; and may be used to the one purpose as well as to the other . *stop*
But this objection will have little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the laws , which form the greatest blemish in the character and genius of our governments . *stop*
They will consider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of law-making , and to keep things in the same state in which they happen to be at any given period , as much more likely to do good than harm ; because it is favorable to greater stability in the system of legislation . *stop*
The injury which may possibly be done by defeating a few good laws , will be amply compensated by the advantage of preventing a number of bad ones . *stop*
Nor is this all . *stop*
The superior weight and influence of the legislative body in a free government , and the hazard to the Executive in a trial of strength with that body , afford a satisfactory security that the negative would generally be employed with great caution ; and there would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness in the exercise of it . *stop*
A king of Great Britain , with all his train of sovereign attributes , and with all the influence he draws from a thousand sources , would , at this day , hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions of the two houses of Parliament . *stop*
He would not fail to exert the utmost resources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to him , in its progress to the throne , to avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect , or of risking the displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the legislative body . *stop*
Nor is it probable , that he would ultimately venture to exert his prerogatives , but in a case of manifest propriety , or extreme necessity . *stop*
All well-informed men in that kingdom will accede to the justness of this remark . *stop*
A very considerable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown has been exercised . *stop*
If a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a British monarch , would have scruples about the exercise of the power under consideration , how much greater caution may be reasonably expected in a President of the United States , clothed for the short period of four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and purely republican ? *stop*
It is evident that there would be greater danger of his not using his power when necessary , than of his using it too often , or too much . *stop*
An argument , indeed , against its expediency , has been drawn from this very source . *stop*
It has been represented , on this account , as a power odious in appearance , useless in practice . *stop*
But it will not follow , that because it might be rarely exercised , it would never be exercised . *stop*
In the case for which it is chiefly designed , that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights of the Executive , or in a case in which the public good was evidently and palpably sacrificed , a man of tolerable firmness would avail himself of his constitutional means of defense , and would listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility . *stop*
In the former supposition , his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate interest in the power of his office ; in the latter , by the probability of the sanction of his constituents , who , though they would naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case , would hardly suffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain case . *stop*
I speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a common share of firmness . *stop*
There are men who , under any circumstances , will have the courage to do their duty at every hazard . *stop*
But the convention have pursued a mean in this business , which will both facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this respect in the executive magistrate , and make its efficacy to depend on the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body . *stop*
Instead of an absolute negative , it is proposed to give the Executive the qualified negative already described . *stop*
This is a power which would be much more readily exercised than the other . *stop*
A man who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single VETO , might not scruple to return it for reconsideration ; subject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one third of each house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections . *stop*
He would be encouraged by the reflection , that if his opposition should prevail , it would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the legislative body , whose influence would be united with his in supporting the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion . *stop*
A direct and categorical negative has something in the appearance of it more harsh , and more apt to irritate , than the mere suggestion of argumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to whom they are addressed . *stop*
In proportion as it would be less apt to offend , it would be more apt to be exercised ; and for this very reason , it may in practice be found more effectual . *stop*
It is to be hoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern so large a proportion as two thirds of both branches of the legislature at the same time ; and this , too , in spite of the counterposing weight of the Executive . *stop*
It is at any rate far less probable that this should be the case , than that such views should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority . *stop*
A power of this nature in the Executive , will often have a silent and unperceived , though forcible , operation . *stop*
When men , engaged in unjustifiable pursuits , are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they can not control , they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition , from doing what they would with eagerness rush into , if no such external impediments were to be feared . *stop*
This qualified negative , as has been elsewhere remarked , is in this State vested in a council , consisting of the governor , with the chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court , or any two of them . *stop*
It has been freely employed upon a variety of occasions , and frequently with success . *stop*
And its utility has become so apparent , that persons who , in compiling the Constitution , were violent opposers of it , have from experience become its declared admirers . *stop*
I have in another place remarked , that the convention , in the formation of this part of their plan , had departed from the model of the constitution of this State , in favor of that of Massachusetts . *stop*
Two strong reasons may be imagined for this preference . *stop*
One is that the judges , who are to be the interpreters of the law , might receive an improper bias , from having given a previous opinion in their revisionary capacities ; the other is that by being often associated with the Executive , they might be induced to embark too far in the political views of that magistrate , and thus a dangerous combination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and judiciary departments . *stop*
It is impossible to keep the judges too distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws . *stop*
It is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be either corrupted or influenced by the Executive . *stop*

74 The Command of the Military and Naval Forces , and the Pardoning Power of the Executive . *stop*
From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , March 25 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE President of the United States is to be `` commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States , and of the militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United States . '' *stop*
The propriety of this provision is so evident in itself , and it is , at the same time , so consonant to the precedents of the State constitutions in general , that little need be said to explain or enforce it . *stop*
Even those of them which have , in other respects , coupled the chief magistrate with a council , have for the most part concentrated the military authority in him alone . *stop*
Of all the cares or concerns of government , the direction of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single hand . *stop*
The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength ; and the power of directing and employing the common strength , forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority . *stop*
`` The President may require the opinion , in writing , of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective officers . '' *stop*
This I consider as a mere redundancy in the plan , as the right for which it provides would result of itself from the office . *stop*
He is also to be authorized to grant `` reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States , except in cases of impeachment . '' *stop*
Humanity and good policy conspire to dictate , that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed . *stop*
The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity , that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt , justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel . *stop*
As the sense of responsibility is always strongest , in proportion as it is undivided , it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law , and least apt to yield to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its vengeance . *stop*
The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature depended on his sole fiat , would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution ; the dread of being accused of weakness or connivance , would beget equal circumspection , though of a different kind . *stop*
On the other hand , as men generally derive confidence from their numbers , they might often encourage each other in an act of obduracy , and might be less sensible to the apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected clemency . *stop*
On these accounts , one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government , than a body of men . *stop*
The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the President has , if I mistake not , been only contested in relation to the crime of treason . *stop*
This , it has been urged , ought to have depended upon the assent of one , or both , of the branches of the legislative body . *stop*
I shall not deny that there are strong reasons to be assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that body , or of a part of it . *stop*
As treason is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the society , when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the offender , there seems a fitness in referring the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the legislature . *stop*
And this ought the rather to be the case , as the supposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate ought not to be entirely excluded . *stop*
But there are also strong objections to such a plan . *stop*
It is not to be doubted , that a single man of prudence and good sense is better fitted , in delicate conjunctures , to balance the motives which may plead for and against the remission of the punishment , than any numerous body whatever . *stop*
It deserves particular attention , that treason will often be connected with seditions which embrace a large proportion of the community ; as lately happened in Massachusetts . *stop*
In every such case , we might expect to see the representation of the people tainted with the same spirit which had given birth to the offense . *stop*
And when parties were pretty equally matched , the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the condemned person , availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of others , might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an example was necessary . *stop*
On the other hand , when the sedition had proceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the major party , they might often be found obstinate and inexorable , when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency . *stop*
But the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case to the Chief Magistrate is this : in seasons of insurrection or rebellion , there are often critical moments , when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth ; and which , if suffered to pass unimproved , it may never be possible afterwards to recall . *stop*
The dilatory process of convening the legislature , or one of its branches , for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the measure , would frequently be the occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity . *stop*
The loss of a week , a day , an hour , may sometimes be fatal . *stop*
If it should be observed , that a discretionary power , with a view to such contingencies , might be occasionally conferred upon the President , it may be answered in the first place , that it is questionable , whether , in a limited Constitution , that power could be delegated by law ; and in the second place , that it would generally be impolitic beforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of impunity . *stop*
A proceeding of this kind , out of the usual course , would be likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or of weakness , and would have a tendency to embolden guilt . *stop*

75 The Treaty-Making Power of the Executive For the Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , March 26 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE President is to have power , `` by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the senators present concur . '' *stop*
Though this provision has been assailed , on different grounds , with no small degree of vehemence , I scruple not to declare my firm persuasion , that it is one of the best digested and most unexceptionable parts of the plan . *stop*
One ground of objection is the trite topic of the intermixture of powers ; some contending that the President ought alone to possess the power of making treaties ; others , that it ought to have been exclusively deposited in the Senate . *stop*
Another source of objection is derived from the small number of persons by whom a treaty may be made . *stop*
Of those who espouse this objection , a part are of opinion that the House of Representatives ought to have been associated in the business , while another part seem to think that nothing more was necessary than to have substituted two thirds of all the members of the Senate , to two thirds of the members present . *stop*
As I flatter myself the observations made in a preceding number upon this part of the plan must have sufficed to place it , to a discerning eye , in a very favorable light , I shall here content myself with offering only some supplementary remarks , principally with a view to the objections which have been just stated . *stop*
With regard to the intermixture of powers , I shall rely upon the explanations already given in other places , of the true sense of the rule upon which that objection is founded ; and shall take it for granted , as an inference from them , that the union of the Executive with the Senate , in the article of treaties , is no infringement of that rule . *stop*
I venture to add , that the particular nature of the power of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union . *stop*
Though several writers on the subject of government place that power in the class of executive authorities , yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition ; for if we attend carefully to its operation , it will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the executive character , though it does not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them . *stop*
The essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws , or , in other words , to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society ; while the execution of the laws , and the employment of the common strength , either for this purpose or for the common defense , seem to comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate . *stop*
The power of making treaties is , plainly , neither the one nor the other . *stop*
It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws , nor to the enaction of new ones ; and still less to an exertion of the common strength . *stop*
Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations , which have the force of law , but derive it from the obligations of good faith . *stop*
They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject , but agreements between sovereign and sovereign . *stop*
The power in question seems therefore to form a distinct department , and to belong , properly , neither to the legislative nor to the executive . *stop*
The qualities elsewhere detailed as indispensable in the management of foreign negotiations , point out the Executive as the most fit agent in those transactions ; while the vast importance of the trust , and the operation of treaties as laws , plead strongly for the participation of the whole or a portion of the legislative body in the office of making them . *stop*
However proper or safe it may be in governments where the executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch , to commit to him the entire power of making treaties , it would be utterly unsafe and improper to intrust that power to an elective magistrate of four years ' duration . *stop*
It has been remarked , upon another occasion , and the remark is unquestionably just , that an hereditary monarch , though often the oppressor of his people , has personally too much stake in the government to be in any material danger of being corrupted by foreign powers . *stop*
But a man raised from the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate , possessed of a moderate or slender fortune , and looking forward to a period not very remote when he may probably be obliged to return to the station from which he was taken , might sometimes be under temptations to sacrifice his duty to his interest , which it would require superlative virtue to withstand . *stop*
An avaricious man might be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth . *stop*
An ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement , by the aid of a foreign power , the price of his treachery to his constituents . *stop*
The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind , as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world , to the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as would be a President of the United States . *stop*
To have intrusted the power of making treaties to the Senate alone , would have been to relinquish the benefits of the constitutional agency of the President in the conduct of foreign negotiations . *stop*
It is true that the Senate would , in that case , have the option of employing him in this capacity , but they would also have the option of letting it alone , and pique or cabal might induce the latter rather than the former . *stop*
Besides this , the ministerial servant of the Senate could not be expected to enjoy the confidence and respect of foreign powers in the same degree with the constitutional representatives of the nation , and , of course , would not be able to act with an equal degree of weight or efficacy . *stop*
While the Union would , from this cause , lose a considerable advantage in the management of its external concerns , the people would lose the additional security which would result from the co-operation of the Executive . *stop*
Though it would be imprudent to confide in him solely so important a trust , yet it can not be doubted that his participation would materially add to the safety of the society . *stop*
It must indeed be clear to a demonstration that the joint possession of the power in question , by the President and Senate , would afford a greater prospect of security , than the separate possession of it by either of them . *stop*
And whoever has maturely weighed the circumstances which must concur in the appointment of a President , will be satisfied that the office will always bid fair to be filled by men of such characters as to render their concurrence in the formation of treaties peculiarly desirable , as well on the score of wisdom , as on that of integrity . *stop*
The remarks made in a former number , which have been alluded to in another part of this paper , will apply with conclusive force against the admission of the House of Representatives to a share in the formation of treaties . *stop*
The fluctuating and , taking its future increase into the account , the multitudinous composition of that body , forbid us to expect in it those qualities which are essential to the proper execution of such a trust . *stop*
Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of foreign politics ; a steady and systematic adherence to the same views ; a nice and uniform sensibility to national character ; decision , secrecy , and despatch , are incompatible with the genius of a body so variable and so numerous . *stop*
The very complication of the business , by introducing a necessity of the concurrence of so many different bodies , would of itself afford a solid objection . *stop*
The greater frequency of the calls upon the House of Representatives , and the greater length of time which it would often be necessary to keep them together when convened , to obtain their sanction in the progressive stages of a treaty , would be a source of so great inconvenience and expense as alone ought to condemn the project . *stop*
The only objection which remains to be canvassed , is that which would substitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members composing the senatorial body , to that of two thirds of the members present . *stop*
It has been shown , under the second head of our inquiries , that all provisions which require more than the majority of any body to its resolutions , have a direct tendency to embarrass the operations of the government , and an indirect one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the minority . *stop*
This consideration seems sufficient to determine our opinion , that the convention have gone as far in the endeavor to secure the advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as could have been reconciled either with the activity of the public councils or with a reasonable regard to the major sense of the community . *stop*
If two thirds of the whole number of members had been required , it would , in many cases , from the non-attendance of a part , amount in practice to a necessity of unanimity . *stop*
And the history of every political establishment in which this principle has prevailed , is a history of impotence , perplexity , and disorder . *stop*
Proofs of this position might be adduced from the examples of the Roman Tribuneship , the Polish Diet , and the States-General of the Netherlands , did not an example at home render foreign precedents unnecessary . *stop*
To require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not , in all probability , contribute to the advantages of a numerous agency , better then merely to require a proportion of the attending members . *stop*
The former , by making a determinate number at all times requisite to a resolution , diminishes the motives to punctual attendance . *stop*
The latter , by making the capacity of the body to depend on a proportion which may be varied by the absence or presence of a single member , has the contrary effect . *stop*
And as , by promoting punctuality , it tends to keep the body complete , there is great likelihood that its resolutions would generally be dictated by as great a number in this case as in the other ; while there would be much fewer occasions of delay . *stop*
It ought not to be forgotten that , under the existing Confederation , two members may , and usually do , represent a State ; whence it happens that Congress , who now are solely invested with all the powers of the Union , rarely consist of a greater number of persons than would compose the intended Senate . *stop*
If we add to this , that as the members vote by States , and that where there is only a single member present from a State , his vote is lost , it will justify a supposition that the active voices in the Senate , where the members are to vote individually , would rarely fall short in number of the active voices in the existing Congress . *stop*
When , in addition to these considerations , we take into view the co-operation of the President , we shall not hesitate to infer that the people of America would have greater security against an improper use of the power of making treaties , under the new Constitution , than they now enjoy under the Confederation . *stop*
And when we proceed still one step further , and look forward to the probable augmentation of the Senate , by the erection of new States , we shall not only perceive ample ground of confidence in the sufficiency of the members to whose agency that power will be intrusted , but we shall probably be led to conclude that a body more numerous than the Senate would be likely to become , would be very little fit for the proper discharge of the trust . *stop*

76 The Appointing Power of the Executive From the New York Packet . *stop*
Tuesday , April 1 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE President is `` to nominate , and , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , to appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the Supreme Court , and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution . *stop*
But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper , in the President alone , or in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . *stop*
The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies which may happen during the recess of the Senate , by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session . '' *stop*
It has been observed in a former paper , that `` the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration . '' *stop*
If the justness of this observation be admitted , the mode of appointing the officers of the United States contained in the foregoing clauses , must , when examined , be allowed to be entitled to particular commendation . *stop*
It is not easy to conceive a plan better calculated than this to promote a judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the Union ; and it will not need proof , that on this point must essentially depend the character of its administration . *stop*
It will be agreed on all hands , that the power of appointment , in ordinary cases , ought to be modified in one of three ways . *stop*
It ought either to be vested in a single man , or in a select assembly of a moderate number ; or in a single man , with the concurrence of such an assembly . *stop*
The exercise of it by the people at large will be readily admitted to be impracticable ; as waiving every other consideration , it would leave them little time to do anything else . *stop*
When , therefore , mention is made in the subsequent reasonings of an assembly or body of men , what is said must be understood to relate to a select body or assembly , of the description already given . *stop*
The people collectively , from their number and from their dispersed situation , can not be regulated in their movements by that systematic spirit of cabal and intrigue , which will be urged as the chief objections to reposing the power in question in a body of men . *stop*
Those who have themselves reflected upon the subject , or who have attended to the observations made in other parts of these papers , in relation to the appointment of the President , will , I presume , agree to the position , that there would always be great probability of having the place supplied by a man of abilities , at least respectable . *stop*
Premising this , I proceed to lay it down as a rule , that one man of discernment is better fitted to analyze and estimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices , than a body of men of equal or perhaps even of superior discernment . *stop*
The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation . *stop*
He will , on this account , feel himself under stronger obligations , and more interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be filled , and to prefer with impartiality the persons who may have the fairest pretensions to them . *stop*
He will have fewer personal attachments to gratify , than a body of men who may each be supposed to have an equal number ; and will be so much the less liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of affection . *stop*
A single well-directed man , by a single understanding , can not be distracted and warped by that diversity of views , feelings , and interests , which frequently distract and warp the resolutions of a collective body . *stop*
There is nothing so apt to agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether they relate to ourselves or to others , who are to be the objects of our choice or preference . *stop*
Hence , in every exercise of the power of appointing to offices , by an assembly of men , we must expect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes , partialities and antipathies , attachments and animosities , which are felt by those who compose the assembly . *stop*
The choice which may at any time happen to be made under such circumstances , will of course be the result either of a victory gained by one party over the other , or of a compromise between the parties . *stop*
In either case , the intrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight . *stop*
In the first , the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party , will be more considered than those which fit the person for the station . *stop*
In the last , the coalition will commonly turn upon some interested equivalent : `` Give us the man we wish for this office , and you shall have the one you wish for that . '' *stop*
This will be the usual condition of the bargain . *stop*
And it will rarely happen that the advancement of the public service will be the primary object either of party victories or of party negotiations . *stop*
The truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the provision made , in this respect , by the convention . *stop*
They contend that the President ought solely to have been authorized to make the appointments under the federal government . *stop*
But it is easy to show , that every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would , in substance , be derived from the power of nomination , which is proposed to be conferred upon him ; while several disadvantages which might attend the absolute power of appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided . *stop*
In the act of nomination , his judgment alone would be exercised ; and as it would be his sole duty to point out the man who , with the approbation of the Senate , should fill an office , his responsibility would be as complete as if he were to make the final appointment . *stop*
There can , in this view , be no difference between nominating and appointing . *stop*
The same motives which would influence a proper discharge of his duty in one case , would exist in the other . *stop*
And as no man could be appointed but on his previous nomination , every man who might be appointed would be , in fact , his choice . *stop*
But might not his nomination be overruled ? *stop*
I grant it might , yet this could only be to make place for another nomination by himself . *stop*
The person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference , though perhaps not in the first degree . *stop*
It is also not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled . *stop*
The Senate could not be tempted , by the preference they might feel to another , to reject the one proposed ; because they could not assure themselves , that the person they might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination . *stop*
They could not even be certain , that a future nomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them ; and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected , and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate , it is not likely that their sanction would often be refused , where there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal . *stop*
To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate ? *stop*
I answer , that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful , though , in general , a silent operation . *stop*
It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President , and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice , from family connection , from personal attachment , or from a view to popularity . *stop*
In addition to this , it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration . *stop*
It will readily be comprehended , that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices , would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests , than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body , and that body an entire branch of the legislature . *stop*
The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing . *stop*
The danger to his own reputation , and , in the case of an elective magistrate , to his political existence , from betraying a spirit of favoritism , or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity , to the observation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public , could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other . *stop*
He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward , for the most distinguished or lucrative stations , candidates who had no other merit than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged , or of being in some way or other personally allied to him , or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure . *stop*
To this reasoning it has been objected that the President , by the influence of the power of nomination , may secure the complaisance of the Senate to his views . *stop*
This supposition of universal venalty in human nature is little less an error in political reasoning , than the supposition of universal rectitude . *stop*
The institution of delegated power implies , that there is a portion of virtue and honor among mankind , which may be a reasonable foundation of confidence ; and experience justifies the theory . *stop*
It has been found to exist in the most corrupt periods of the most corrupt governments . *stop*
The venalty of the British House of Commons has been long a topic of accusation against that body , in the country to which they belong as well as in this ; and it can not be doubted that the charge is , to a considerable extent , well founded . *stop*
But it is as little to be doubted , that there is always a large proportion of the body , which consists of independent and public-spirited men , who have an influential weight in the councils of the nation . *stop*
Hence it is ( the present reign not excepted ) that the sense of that body is often seen to control the inclinations of the monarch , both with regard to men and to measures . *stop*
Though it might therefore be allowable to suppose that the Executive might occasionally influence some individuals in the Senate , yet the supposition , that he could in general purchase the integrity of the whole body , would be forced and improbable . *stop*
A man disposed to view human nature as it is , without either flattering its virtues or exaggerating its vices , will see sufficient ground of confidence in the probity of the Senate , to rest satisfied , not only that it will be impracticable to the Executive to corrupt or seduce a majority of its members , but that the necessity of its co-operation , in the business of appointments , will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of that magistrate . *stop*
Nor is the integrity of the Senate the only reliance . *stop*
The Constitution has provided some important guards against the danger of executive influence upon the legislative body : it declares that `` No senator or representative shall during the time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil office under the United States , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased , during such time ; and no person , holding any office under the United States , shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office .

77 The Appointing Power Continued and Other Powers of the Executive Considered . *stop*
From The Independent Journal . *stop*
Wednesday , April 2 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IT HAS been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the Senate , in the business of appointments , that it would contribute to the stability of the administration . *stop*
The consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint . *stop*
A change of the Chief Magistrate , therefore , would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected , if he were the sole disposer of offices . *stop*
Where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it , a new President would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable to him , by the apprehension that a discountenance of the Senate might frustrate the attempt , and bring some degree of discredit upon himself . *stop*
Those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration , will be most disposed to prize a provision which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body which , from the greater permanency of its own composition , will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of the government . *stop*
To this union of the Senate with the President , in the article of appointments , it has in some cases been suggested that it would serve to give the President an undue influence over the Senate , and in others that it would have an opposite tendency -- a strong proof that neither suggestion is true . *stop*
To state the first in its proper form , is to refute it . *stop*
It amounts to this : the President would have an improper influence over the Senate , because the Senate would have the power of restraining him . *stop*
This is an absurdity in terms . *stop*
It can not admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body , than a mere power of nomination subject to their control . *stop*
Let us take a view of the converse of the proposition : `` the Senate would influence the Executive . '' *stop*
As I have had occasion to remark in several other instances , the indistinctness of the objection forbids a precise answer . *stop*
In what manner is this influence to be exerted ? *stop*
In relation to what objects ? *stop*
The power of influencing a person , in the sense in which it is here used , must imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him . *stop*
How could the Senate confer a benefit upon the President by the manner of employing their right of negative upon his nominations ? *stop*
If it be said they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a favorite choice , when public motives might dictate a different conduct , I answer , that the instances in which the President could be personally interested in the result , would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the Senate . *stop*
The POWER which can originate the disposition of honors and emoluments , is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the POWER which can merely obstruct their course . *stop*
If by influencing the President be meant restraining him , this is precisely what must have been intended . *stop*
And it has been shown that the restraint would be salutary , at the same time that it would not be such as to destroy a single advantage to be looked for from the uncontrolled agency of that Magistrate . *stop*
The right of nomination would produce all the ( good , without the ill. ) ( good of that of appointment , and would in a great measure avoid its evils . ) *stop*
Upon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the officers of the proposed government with that which is established by the constitution of this State , a decided preference must be given to the former . *stop*
In that plan the power of nomination is unequivocally vested in the Executive . *stop*
And as there would be a necessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an entire branch of the legislature , the circumstances attending an appointment , from the mode of conducting it , would naturally become matters of notoriety ; and the public would be at no loss to determine what part had been performed by the different actors . *stop*
The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the President singly and absolutely . *stop*
The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the Senate ; aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the Executive . *stop*
If an ill appointment should be made , the Executive for nominating , and the Senate for approving , would participate , though in different degrees , in the opprobrium and disgrace . *stop*
The reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in this State . *stop*
The council of appointment consists of from three to five persons , of whom the governor is always one . *stop*
This small body , shut up in a private apartment , impenetrable to the public eye , proceed to the execution of the trust committed to them . *stop*
It is known that the governor claims the right of nomination , upon the strength of some ambiguous expressions in the constitution ; but it is not known to what extent , or in what manner he exercises it ; nor upon what occasions he is contradicted or opposed . *stop*
The censure of a bad appointment , on account of the uncertainty of its author , and for want of a determinate object , has neither poignancy nor duration . *stop*
And while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open , all idea of responsibility is lost . *stop*
The most that the public can know , is that the governor claims the right of nomination ; that two out of the inconsiderable number of four men can too often be managed without much difficulty ; that if some of the members of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character , it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient ; and that from whatever cause it may proceed , a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made . *stop*
Whether a governor of this State avails himself of the ascendant he must necessarily have , in this delicate and important part of the administration , to prefer to offices men who are best qualified for them , or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement of persons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will , and to the support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal influence , are questions which , unfortunately for the community , can only be the subjects of speculation and conjecture . *stop*
Every mere council of appointment , however constituted , will be a conclave , in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope . *stop*
Their number , without an unwarrantable increase of expense , can not be large enough to preclude a facility of combination . *stop*
And as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for , the desire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places . *stop*
The private attachments of one man might easily be satisfied ; but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen , or of twenty men , would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments of the government in a few families , and would lead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived . *stop*
If , to avoid an accumulation of offices , there was to be a frequent change in the persons who were to compose the council , this would involve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent . *stop*
Such a council would also be more liable to executive influence than the Senate , because they would be fewer in number , and would act less immediately under the public inspection . *stop*
Such a council , in fine , as a substitute for the plan of the convention , would be productive of an increase of expense , a multiplication of the evils which spring from favoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors , a decrease of stability in the administration of the government , and a diminution of the security against an undue influence of the Executive . *stop*
And yet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential amendment in the proposed Constitution . *stop*
I could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject of appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there have appeared some , though but few advocates ; I mean that of uniting the House of Representatives in the power of making them . *stop*
I shall , however , do little more than mention it , as I can not imagine that it is likely to gain the countenance of any considerable part of the community . *stop*
A body so fluctuating and at the same time so numerous , can never be deemed proper for the exercise of that power . *stop*
Its unfitness will appear manifest to all , when it is recollected that in half a century it may consist of three or four hundred persons . *stop*
All the advantages of the stability , both of the Executive and of the Senate , would be defeated by this union , and infinite delays and embarrassments would be occasioned . *stop*
The example of most of the States in their local constitutions encourages us to reprobate the idea . *stop*
The only remaining powers of the Executive are comprehended in giving information to Congress of the state of the Union ; in recommending to their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient ; in convening them , or either branch , upon extraordinary occasions ; in adjourning them when they can not themselves agree upon the time of adjournment ; in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers ; in faithfully executing the laws ; and in commissioning all the officers of the United States . *stop*
Except some cavils about the power of convening either house of the legislature , and that of receiving ambassadors , no objection has been made to this class of authorities ; nor could they possibly admit of any . *stop*
It required , indeed , an insatiable avidity for censure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to . *stop*
In regard to the power of convening either house of the legislature , I shall barely remark , that in respect to the Senate at least , we can readily discover a good reason for it . *stop*
AS this body has a concurrent power with the Executive in the article of treaties , it might often be necessary to call it together with a view to this object , when it would be unnecessary and improper to convene the House of Representatives . *stop*
As to the reception of ambassadors , what I have said in a former paper will furnish a sufficient answer . *stop*
We have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of the executive department , which , I have endeavored to show , combines , as far as republican principles will admit , all the requisites to energy . *stop*
The remaining inquiry is : Does it also combine the requisites to safety , in a republican sense -- a due dependence on the people , a due responsibility ? *stop*
The answer to this question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other characteristics , and is satisfactorily deducible from these circumstances ; from the election of the President once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose ; and from his being at all times liable to impeachment , trial , dismission from office , incapacity to serve in any other , and to forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law . *stop*
But these precautions , great as they are , are not the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public security . *stop*
In the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared , the Chief Magistrate of the United States would , by that plan , be subjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body . *stop*
What more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people ? *stop*

78 The Judiciary Department From McLEAN 'S Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : WE PROCEED now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government . *stop*
In unfolding the defects of the existing Confederation , the utility and necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out . *stop*
It is the less necessary to recapitulate the considerations there urged , as the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed ; the only questions which have been raised being relative to the manner of constituting it , and to its extent . *stop*
To these points , therefore , our observations shall be confined . *stop*
The manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several objects : 1st . *stop*
The mode of appointing the judges . *stop*
2d . *stop*
The tenure by which they are to hold their places . *stop*
3d . *stop*
The partition of the judiciary authority between different courts , and their relations to each other . *stop*
First . *stop*
As to the mode of appointing the judges ; this is the same with that of appointing the officers of the Union in general , and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers , that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition . *stop*
Second . *stop*
As to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places ; this chiefly concerns their duration in office ; the provisions for their support ; the precautions for their responsibility . *stop*
According to the plan of the convention , all judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices during good behavior ; which is conformable to the most approved of the State constitutions and among the rest , to that of this State . *stop*
Its propriety having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan , is no light symptom of the rage for objection , which disorders their imaginations and judgments . *stop*
The standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy , is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government . *stop*
In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince ; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body . *stop*
And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government , to secure a steady , upright , and impartial administration of the laws . *stop*
Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive , that , in a government in which they are separated from each other , the judiciary , from the nature of its functions , will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution ; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them . *stop*
The Executive not only dispenses the honors , but holds the sword of the community . *stop*
The legislature not only commands the purse , but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated . *stop*
The judiciary , on the contrary , has no influence over either the sword or the purse ; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society ; and can take no active resolution whatever . *stop*
It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL , but merely judgment ; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments . *stop*
This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences . *stop*
It proves incontestably , that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power ; that it can never attack with success either of the other two ; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks . *stop*
It equally proves , that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice , the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter ; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive . *stop*
For I agree , that `` there is no liberty , if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers . '' *stop*
And it proves , in the last place , that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone , but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments ; that as all the effects of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter , notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation ; that as , from the natural feebleness of the judiciary , it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered , awed , or influenced by its co-ordinate branches ; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office , this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution , and , in a great measure , as the citadel of the public justice and the public security . *stop*
The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution . *stop*
By a limited Constitution , I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority ; such , for instance , as that it shall pass no bills of attainder , no ex post facto laws , and the like . *stop*
Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice , whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void . *stop*
Without this , all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing . *stop*
Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void , because contrary to the Constitution , has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power . *stop*
It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void , must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void . *stop*
As this doctrine is of great importance in all the American constitutions , a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests can not be unacceptable . *stop*
There is no position which depends on clearer principles , than that every act of a delegated authority , contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised , is void . *stop*
No legislative act , therefore , contrary to the Constitution , can be valid . *stop*
To deny this , would be to affirm , that the deputy is greater than his principal ; that the servant is above his master ; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves ; that men acting by virtue of powers , may do not only what their powers do not authorize , but what they forbid . *stop*
If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers , and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments , it may be answered , that this can not be the natural presumption , where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution . *stop*
It is not otherwise to be supposed , that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents . *stop*
It is far more rational to suppose , that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature , in order , among other things , to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority . *stop*
The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts . *stop*
A constitution is , in fact , and must be regarded by the judges , as a fundamental law . *stop*
It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning , as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body . *stop*
If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two , that which has the superior obligation and validity ought , of course , to be preferred ; or , in other words , the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute , the intention of the people to the intention of their agents . *stop*
Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power . *stop*
It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both ; and that where the will of the legislature , declared in its statutes , stands in opposition to that of the people , declared in the Constitution , the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former . *stop*
They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws , rather than by those which are not fundamental . *stop*
This exercise of judicial discretion , in determining between two contradictory laws , is exemplified in a familiar instance . *stop*
It not uncommonly happens , that there are two statutes existing at one time , clashing in whole or in part with each other , and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression . *stop*
In such a case , it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation . *stop*
So far as they can , by any fair construction , be reconciled to each other , reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done ; where this is impracticable , it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one , in exclusion of the other . *stop*
The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is , that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first . *stop*
But this is a mere rule of construction , not derived from any positive law , but from the nature and reason of the thing . *stop*
It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision , but adopted by themselves , as consonant to truth and propriety , for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law . *stop*
They thought it reasonable , that between the interfering acts of an EQUAL authority , that which was the last indication of its will should have the preference . *stop*
But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority , of an original and derivative power , the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed . *stop*
They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority ; and that accordingly , whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution , it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former . *stop*
It can be of no weight to say that the courts , on the pretense of a repugnancy , may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature . *stop*
This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes ; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute . *stop*
The courts must declare the sense of the law ; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT , the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body . *stop*
The observation , if it prove any thing , would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body . *stop*
If , then , the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments , this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices , since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty . *stop*
This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors , which the arts of designing men , or the influence of particular conjunctures , sometimes disseminate among the people themselves , and which , though they speedily give place to better information , and more deliberate reflection , have a tendency , in the meantime , to occasion dangerous innovations in the government , and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community . *stop*
Though I trust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its enemies , in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government , which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established Constitution , whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness , yet it is not to be inferred from this principle , that the representatives of the people , whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents , incompatible with the provisions in the existing Constitution , would , on that account , be justifiable in a violation of those provisions ; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape , than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body . *stop*
Until the people have , by some solemn and authoritative act , annulled or changed the established form , it is binding upon themselves collectively , as well as individually ; and no presumption , or even knowledge , of their sentiments , can warrant their representatives in a departure from it , prior to such an act . *stop*
But it is easy to see , that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution , where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community . *stop*
But it is not with a view to infractions of the Constitution only , that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the society . *stop*
These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens , by unjust and partial laws . *stop*
Here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws . *stop*
It not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed , but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them ; who , perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts , are in a manner compelled , by the very motives of the injustice they meditate , to qualify their attempts . *stop*
This is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments , than but few may be aware of . *stop*
The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more States than one ; and though they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed , they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and disinterested . *stop*
Considerate men , of every description , ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts : as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice , by which he may be a gainer to-day . *stop*
And every man must now feel , that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of public and private confidence , and to introduce in its stead universal distrust and distress . *stop*
That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution , and of individuals , which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice , can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission . *stop*
Periodical appointments , however regulated , or by whomsoever made , would , in some way or other , be fatal to their necessary independence . *stop*
If the power of making them was committed either to the Executive or legislature , there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it ; if to both , there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either ; if to the people , or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose , there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity , to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the Constitution and the laws . *stop*
There is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices , which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require . *stop*
It has been frequently remarked , with great propriety , that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government . *stop*
To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts , it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents , which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them ; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind , that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk , and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them . *stop*
Hence it is , that there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges . *stop*
And making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature , the number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge . *stop*
These considerations apprise us , that the government can have no great option between fit character ; and that a temporary duration in office , which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench , would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able , and less well qualified , to conduct it with utility and dignity . *stop*
In the present circumstances of this country , and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to come , the disadvantages on this score would be greater than they may at first sight appear ; but it must be confessed , that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the other aspects of the subject . *stop*
Upon the whole , there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have established good behavior as the tenure of their judicial offices , in point of duration ; and that so far from being blamable on this account , their plan would have been inexcusably defective , if it had wanted this important feature of good government . *stop*
The experience of Great Britain affords an illustrious comment on the excellence of the institution . *stop*

79 The Judiciary Continued From MCLEAN 's Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : NEXT to permanency in office , nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support . *stop*
The remark made in relation to the President is equally applicable here . *stop*
In the general course of human nature , a power over a man 's subsistence amounts to a power over his will . *stop*
And we can never hope to see realized in practice , the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power , in any system which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter . *stop*
The enlightened friends to good government in every State , have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the State constitutions on this head . *stop*
Some of these indeed have declared that permanent salaries should be established for the judges ; but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions . *stop*
Something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite . *stop*
The plan of the convention accordingly has provided that the judges of the United States `` shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office . '' *stop*
This , all circumstances considered , is the most eligible provision that could have been devised . *stop*
It will readily be understood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible . *stop*
What might be extravagant to-day , might in half a century become penurious and inadequate . *stop*
It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances , yet under such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the worse . *stop*
A man may then be sure of the ground upon which he stands , and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation . *stop*
The clause which has been quoted combines both advantages . *stop*
The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time be altered , as occasion shall require , yet so as never to lessen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office , in respect to him . *stop*
It will be observed that a difference has been made by the convention between the compensation of the President and of the judges , That of the former can neither be increased nor diminished ; that of the latter can only not be diminished . *stop*
This probably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective offices . *stop*
As the President is to be elected for no more than four years , it can rarely happen that an adequate salary , fixed at the commencement of that period , will not continue to be such to its end . *stop*
But with regard to the judges , who , if they behave properly , will be secured in their places for life , it may well happen , especially in the early stages of the government , that a stipend , which would be very sufficient at their first appointment , would become too small in the progress of their service . *stop*
This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy ; and it may be safely affirmed that , together with the permanent tenure of their offices , it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges . *stop*
The precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article respecting impeachments . *stop*
They are liable to be impeached for malconduct by the House of Representatives , and tried by the Senate ; and , if convicted , may be dismissed from office , and disqualified for holding any other . *stop*
This is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character , and is the only one which we find in our own Constitution in respect to our own judges . *stop*
The want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability has been a subject of complaint . *stop*
But all considerate men will be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good purpose . *stop*
The mensuration of the faculties of the mind has , I believe , no place in the catalogue of known arts . *stop*
An attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and inability , would much oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and enmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good . *stop*
The result , except in the case of insanity , must for the most part be arbitrary ; and insanity , without any formal or express provision , may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification . *stop*
The constitution of New York , to avoid investigations that must forever be vague and dangerous , has taken a particular age as the criterion of inability . *stop*
No man can be a judge beyond sixty . *stop*
I believe there are few at present who do not disapprove of this provision . *stop*
There is no station , in relation to which it is less proper than to that of a judge . *stop*
The deliberating and comparing faculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period in men who survive it ; and when , in addition to this circumstance , we consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual vigor , and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the bench , whether more or less numerous , should be in such a situation at the same time , we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of this sort have little to recommend them . *stop*
In a republic , where fortunes are not affluent , and pensions not expedient , the dismission of men from stations in which they have served their country long and usefully , on which they depend for subsistence , and from which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for a livelihood , ought to have some better apology to humanity than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench . *stop*

80 The Powers of the Judiciary From McLEAN 's Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : TO JUDGE with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature , it will be necessary to consider , in the first place , what are its proper objects . *stop*
It seems scarcely to admit of controversy , that the judiciary authority of the Union ought to extend to these several descriptions of cases : 1st , to all those which arise out of the laws of the United States , passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of legislation ; 2d , to all those which concern the execution of the provisions expressly contained in the articles of Union ; 3d , to all those in which the United States are a party ; 4th , to all those which involve the PEACE of the CONFEDERACY , whether they relate to the intercourse between the United States and foreign nations , or to that between the States themselves ; 5th , to all those which originate on the high seas , and are of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction ; and , lastly , to all those in which the State tribunals can not be supposed to be impartial and unbiased . *stop*
The first point depends upon this obvious consideration , that there ought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy to constitutional provisions . *stop*
What , for instance , would avail restrictions on the authority of the State legislatures , without some constitutional mode of enforcing the observance of them ? *stop*
The States , by the plan of the convention , are prohibited from doing a variety of things , some of which are incompatible with the interests of the Union , and others with the principles of good government . *stop*
The imposition of duties on imported articles , and the emission of paper money , are specimens of each kind . *stop*
No man of sense will believe , that such prohibitions would be scrupulously regarded , without some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct the infractions of them . *stop*
This power must either be a direct negative on the State laws , or an authority in the federal courts to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles of Union . *stop*
There is no third course that I can imagine . *stop*
The latter appears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the former , and , I presume , will be most agreeable to the States . *stop*
As to the second point , it is impossible , by any argument or comment , to make it clearer than it is in itself . *stop*
If there are such things as political axioms , the propriety of the judicial power of a government being coextensive with its legislative , may be ranked among the number . *stop*
The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws , decides the question . *stop*
Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes , arising upon the same laws , is a hydra in government , from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed . *stop*
Still less need be said in regard to the third point . *stop*
Controversies between the nation and its members or citizens , can only be properly referred to the national tribunals . *stop*
Any other plan would be contrary to reason , to precedent , and to decorum . *stop*
The fourth point rests on this plain proposition , that the peace of the WHOLE ought not to be left at the disposal of a PART . *stop*
The Union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members . *stop*
And the responsibility for an injury ought ever to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it . *stop*
As the denial or perversion of justice by the sentences of courts , as well as in any other manner , is with reason classed among the just causes of war , it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned . *stop*
This is not less essential to the preservation of the public faith , than to the security of the public tranquillity . *stop*
A distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon treaties and the laws of nations and those which may stand merely on the footing of the municipal law . *stop*
The former kind may be supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction , the latter for that of the States . *stop*
But it is at least problematical , whether an unjust sentence against a foreigner , where the subject of controversy was wholly relative to the lex loci , would not , if unredressed , be an aggression upon his sovereign , as well as one which violated the stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations . *stop*
And a still greater objection to the distinction would result from the immense difficulty , if not impossibility , of a practical discrimination between the cases of one complexion and those of the other . *stop*
So great a proportion of the cases in which foreigners are parties , involve national questions , that it is by far most safe and most expedient to refer all those in which they are concerned to the national tribunals . *stop*
The power of determining causes between two States , between one State and the citizens of another , and between the citizens of different States , is perhaps not less essential to the peace of the Union than that which has been just examined . *stop*
History gives us a horrid picture of the dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated Germany prior to the institution of the Imperial Chamber by Maximilian , towards the close of the fifteenth century ; and informs us , at the same time , of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders and establishing the tranquillity of the empire . *stop*
This was a court invested with authority to decide finally all differences among the members of the Germanic body . *stop*
A method of terminating territorial disputes between the States , under the authority of the federal head , was not unattended to , even in the imperfect system by which they have been hitherto held together . *stop*
But there are many other sources , besides interfering claims of boundary , from which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members of the Union . *stop*
To some of these we have been witnesses in the course of our past experience . *stop*
It will readily be conjectured that I allude to the fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the States . *stop*
And though the proposed Constitution establishes particular guards against the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made their appearance , yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will assume new shapes , that could not be foreseen nor specifically provided against . *stop*
Whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb the harmony between the States , are proper objects of federal superintendence and control . *stop*
It may be esteemed the basis of the Union , that `` the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States . '' *stop*
And if it be a just principle that every government ought to possess the means of executing its own provisions by its own authority , it will follow , that in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the Union will be entitled , the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one State or its citizens are opposed to another State or its citizens . *stop*
To secure the full effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge , it is necessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunal which , having no local attachments , will be likely to be impartial between the different States and their citizens , and which , owing its official existence to the Union , will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which it is founded . *stop*
The fifth point will demand little animadversion . *stop*
The most bigoted idolizers of State authority have not thus far shown a disposition to deny the national judiciary the cognizances of maritime causes . *stop*
These so generally depend on the laws of nations , and so commonly affect the rights of foreigners , that they fall within the considerations which are relative to the public peace . *stop*
The most important part of them are , by the present Confederation , submitted to federal jurisdiction . *stop*
The reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases in which the State tribunals can not be supposed to be impartial , speaks for itself . *stop*
No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cause , or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest or bias . *stop*
This principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating the federal courts as the proper tribunals for the determination of controversies between different States and their citizens . *stop*
And it ought to have the same operation in regard to some cases between citizens of the same State . *stop*
Claims to land under grants of different States , founded upon adverse pretensions of boundary , are of this description . *stop*
The courts of neither of the granting States could be expected to be unbiased . *stop*
The laws may have even prejudged the question , and tied the courts down to decisions in favor of the grants of the State to which they belonged . *stop*
And even where this had not been done , it would be natural that the judges , as men , should feel a strong predilection to the claims of their own government . *stop*
Having thus laid down and discussed the principles which ought to regulate the constitution of the federal judiciary , we will proceed to test , by these principles , the particular powers of which , according to the plan of the convention , it is to be composed . *stop*
It is to comprehend '' all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution , the laws of the United States , and treaties made , or which shall be made , under their authority ; to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls ; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party ; to controversies between two or more States ; between a State and citizens of another State ; between citizens of different States ; between citizens of the same State claiming lands and grants of different States ; and between a State or the citizens thereof and foreign states , citizens , and subjects . '' *stop*
This constitutes the entire mass of the judicial authority of the Union . *stop*
Let us now review it in detail . *stop*
It is , then , to extend : First . *stop*
To all cases in law and equity , arising under the Constitution and the laws of the United States . *stop*
This corresponds with the two first classes of causes , which have been enumerated , as proper for the jurisdiction of the United States . *stop*
It has been asked , what is meant by `` cases arising under the Constitution , '' in contradiction from those '' arising under the laws of the United States '' ? *stop*
The difference has been already explained . *stop*
All the restrictions upon the authority of the State legislatures furnish examples of it . *stop*
They are not , for instance , to emit paper money ; but the interdiction results from the Constitution , and will have no connection with any law of the United States . *stop*
Should paper money , notwithstanding , be emited , the controversies concerning it would be cases arising under the Constitution and not the laws of the United States , in the ordinary signification of the terms . *stop*
This may serve as a sample of the whole . *stop*
It has also been asked , what need of the word `` equity '' . *stop*
What equitable causes can grow out of the Constitution and laws of the United States ? *stop*
There is hardly a subject of litigation between individuals , which may not involve those ingredients of fraud , accident , trust , or hardship , which would render the matter an object of equitable rather than of legal jurisdiction , as the distinction is known and established in several of the States . *stop*
It is the peculiar province , for instance , of a court of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains : these are contracts in which , though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit , sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law , yet there may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or misfortunes of one of the parties , which a court of equity would not tolerate . *stop*
In such cases , where foreigners were concerned on either side , it would be impossible for the federal judicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal jurisdiction . *stop*
Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of different States , may afford another example of the necessity of an equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts . *stop*
This reasoning may not be so palpable in those States where the formal and technical distinction between LAW and EQUITY is not maintained , as in this State , where it is exemplified by every day 's practice . *stop*
The judiciary authority of the Union is to extend : Second . *stop*
To treaties made , or which shall be made , under the authority of the United States , and to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls . *stop*
These belong to the fourth class of the enumerated cases , as they have an evident connection with the preservation of the national peace . *stop*
Third . *stop*
To cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction . *stop*
These form , altogether , the fifth of the enumerated classes of causes proper for the cognizance of the national courts . *stop*
Fourth . *stop*
To controversies to which the United States shall be a party . *stop*
These constitute the third of those classes . *stop*
Fifth . *stop*
To controversies between two or more States ; between a State and citizens of another State ; between citizens of different States . *stop*
These belong to the fourth of those classes , and partake , in some measure , of the nature of the last . *stop*
Sixth . *stop*
To cases between the citizens of the same State , claiming lands under grants of different States . *stop*
These fall within the last class , and are the only instances in which the proposed Constitution directly contemplates the cognizance of disputes between the citizens of the same State . *stop*
Seventh . *stop*
To cases between a State and the citizens thereof , and foreign States , citizens , or subjects . *stop*
These have been already explained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated classes , and have been shown to be , in a peculiar manner , the proper subjects of the national judicature . *stop*
From this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary , as marked out in the Constitution , it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department , and which were necessary to the perfection of the system . *stop*
If some partial inconveniences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan , it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such exceptions , and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences . *stop*
The possibility of particular mischiefs can never be viewed , by a wellinformed mind , as a solid objection to a general principle , which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain general advantages . *stop*

81 The Judiciary Continued , and the Distribution of the Judicial Authority . *stop*
From McLEAN 's Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 . *stop*
HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : LET US now return to the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts , and their relations to each other . *stop*
`` The judicial power of the United States is '' ( by the plan of the convention ) `` to be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress may , from time to time , ordain and establish . '' *stop*
That there ought to be one court of supreme and final jurisdiction , is a proposition which is not likely to be contested . *stop*
The reasons for it have been assigned in another place , and are too obvious to need repetition . *stop*
The only question that seems to have been raised concerning it , is , whether it ought to be a distinct body or a branch of the legislature . *stop*
The same contradiction is observable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in several other cases . *stop*
The very men who object to the Senate as a court of impeachments , on the ground of an improper intermixture of powers , advocate , by implication at least , the propriety of vesting the ultimate decision of all causes , in the whole or in a part of the legislative body . *stop*
The arguments , or rather suggestions , upon which this charge is founded , are to this effect : `` The authority of the proposed Supreme Court of the United States , which is to be a separate and independent body , will be superior to that of the legislature . *stop*
The power of construing the laws according to the spirit of the Constitution , will enable that court to mould them into whatever shape it may think proper ; especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body . *stop*
This is as unprecedented as it is dangerous . *stop*
In Britain , the judicial power , in the last resort , resides in the House of Lords , which is a branch of the legislature ; and this part of the British government has been imitated in the State constitutions in general . *stop*
The Parliament of Great Britain , and the legislatures of the several States , can at any time rectify , by law , the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts . *stop*
But the errors and usurpations of the Supreme Court of the United States will be uncontrollable and remediless . '' *stop*
This , upon examination , will be found to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived fact . *stop*
In the first place , there is not a syllable in the plan under consideration which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the Constitution , or which gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the courts of every State . *stop*
I admit , however , that the Constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws , and that wherever there is an evident opposition , the laws ought to give place to the Constitution . *stop*
But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention , but from the general theory of a limited Constitution ; and as far as it is true , is equally applicable to most , if not to all the State governments . *stop*
There can be no objection , therefore , on this account , to the federal judicature which will not lie against the local judicatures in general , and which will not serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative discretion . *stop*
But perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the particular organization of the Supreme Court ; in its being composed of a distinct body of magistrates , instead of being one of the branches of the legislature , as in the government of Great Britain and that of the State . *stop*
To insist upon this point , the authors of the objection must renounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated maxim , requiring a separation of the departments of power . *stop*
It shall , nevertheless , be conceded to them , agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of these papers , that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a PART of the legislative body . *stop*
But though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule , yet it verges so nearly upon it , as on this account alone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the convention . *stop*
From a body which had even a partial agency in passing bad laws , we could rarely expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the application . *stop*
The same spirit which had operated in making them , would be too apt in interpreting them ; still less could it be expected that men who had infringed the Constitution in the character of legislators , would be disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges . *stop*
Nor is this all . *stop*
Every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior for judicial offices , militates against placing the judiciary power , in the last resort , in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period . *stop*
There is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes , in the first instance , to judges of permanent standing ; in the last , to those of a temporary and mutable constitution . *stop*
And there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of men , selected for their knowledge of the laws , acquired by long and laborious study , to the revision and control of men who , for want of the same advantage , can not but be deficient in that knowledge . *stop*
The members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges ; and as , on this account , there will be great reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information , so , on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party divisions , there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice . *stop*
The habit of being continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the voice both of law and of equity . *stop*
These considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those States who have committed the judicial power , in the last resort , not to a part of the legislature , but to distinct and independent bodies of men . *stop*
Contrary to the supposition of those who have represented the plan of the convention , in this respect , as novel and unprecedented , it is but a copy of the constitutions of New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia ; and the preference which has been given to those models is highly to be commended . *stop*
It is not true , in the second place , that the Parliament of Great Britain , or the legislatures of the particular States , can rectify the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts , in any other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the United States . *stop*
The theory , neither of the British , nor the State constitutions , authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act . *stop*
Nor is there any thing in the proposed Constitution , more than in either of them , by which it is forbidden . *stop*
In the former , as well as in the latter , the impropriety of the thing , on the general principles of law and reason , is the sole obstacle . *stop*
A legislature , without exceeding its province , can not reverse a determination once made in a particular case ; though it may prescribe a new rule for future cases . *stop*
This is the principle , and it applies in all its consequences , exactly in the same manner and extent , to the State governments , as to the national government now under consideration . *stop*
Not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the subject . *stop*
It may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority , which has been upon many occasions reiterated , is in reality a phantom . *stop*
Particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may now and then happen ; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenience , or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political system . *stop*
This may be inferred with certainty , from the general nature of the judicial power , from the objects to which it relates , from the manner in which it is exercised , from its comparative weakness , and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force . *stop*
And the inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative body , and of determining upon them in the other , would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department . *stop*
This is alone a complete security . *stop*
There never can be danger that the judges , by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature , would hazard the united resentment of the body intrusted with it , while this body was possessed of the means of punishing their presumption , by degrading them from their stations . *stop*
While this ought to remove all apprehensions on the subject , it affords , at the same time , a cogent argument for constituting the Senate a court for the trial of impeachments . *stop*
Having now examined , and , I trust , removed the objections to the distinct and independent organization of the Supreme Court , I proceed to consider the propriety of the power of constituting inferior courts , and the relations which will subsist between these and the former . *stop*
The power of constituting inferior courts is evidently calculated to obviate the necessity of having recourse to the Supreme Court in every case of federal cognizance . *stop*
It is intended to enable the national government to institute or authorize , in each State or district of the United States , a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of national jurisdiction within its limits . *stop*
But why , it is asked , might not the same purpose have been accomplished by the instrumentality of the State courts ? *stop*
This admits of different answers . *stop*
Though the fitness and competency of those courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude , yet the substance of the power in question may still be regarded as a necessary part of the plan , if it were only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out of the national Constitution . *stop*
To confer the power of determining such causes upon the existing courts of the several States , would perhaps be as much `` to constitute tribunals , '' as to create new courts with the like power . *stop*
But ought not a more direct and explicit provision to have been made in favor of the State courts ? *stop*
There are , in my opinion , substantial reasons against such a provision : the most discerning can not foresee how far the prevalency of a local spirit may be found to disqualify the local tribunals for the jurisdiction of national causes ; whilst every man may discover , that courts constituted like those of some of the States would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the Union . *stop*
State judges , holding their offices during pleasure , or from year to year , will be too little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the national laws . *stop*
And if there was a necessity for confiding the original cognizance of causes arising under those laws to them there would be a correspondent necessity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as possible . *stop*
In proportion to the grounds of confidence in , or distrust of , the subordinate tribunals , ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals . *stop*
And well satisfied as I am of the propriety of the appellate jurisdiction , in the several classes of causes to which it is extended by the plan of the convention . *stop*
I should consider every thing calculated to give , in practice , an unrestrained course to appeals , as a source of public and private inconvenience . *stop*
I am not sure , but that it will be found highly expedient and useful , to divide the United States into four or five or half a dozen districts ; and to institute a federal court in each district , in lieu of one in every State . *stop*
The judges of these courts , with the aid of the State judges , may hold circuits for the trial of causes in the several parts of the respective districts . *stop*
Justice through them may be administered with ease and despatch ; and appeals may be safely circumscribed within a narrow compass . *stop*
This plan appears to me at present the most eligible of any that could be adopted ; and in order to it , it is necessary that the power of constituting inferior courts should exist in the full extent in which it is to be found in the proposed Constitution . *stop*
These reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind , that the want of such a power would have been a great defect in the plan . *stop*
Let us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be distributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the Union . *stop*
The Supreme Court is to be invested with original jurisdiction , only `` in cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls , and those in which A STATE shall be a party . '' *stop*
Public ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their sovereigns . *stop*
All questions in which they are concerned are so directly connected with the public peace , that , as well for the preservation of this , as out of respect to the sovereignties they represent , it is both expedient and proper that such questions should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory of the nation . *stop*
Though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic character , yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they belong , the same observation is in a great measure applicable to them . *stop*
In cases in which a State might happen to be a party , it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal . *stop*
Though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of this paper , I shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds . *stop*
It has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one State to the citizens of another , would enable them to prosecute that State in the federal courts for the amount of those securities ; a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without foundation . *stop*
It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent . *stop*
This is the general sense , and the general practice of mankind ; and the exemption , as one of the attributes of sovereignty , is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union . *stop*
Unless , therefore , there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention , it will remain with the States , and the danger intimated must be merely ideal . *stop*
The circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of taxation , and need not be repeated here . *stop*
A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us , that there is no color to pretend that the State governments would , by the adoption of that plan , be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way , free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith . *stop*
The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign , and have no pretensions to a compulsive force . *stop*
They confer no right of action , independent of the sovereign will . *stop*
To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe ? *stop*
How could recoveries be enforced ? *stop*
It is evident , it could not be done without waging war against the contracting State ; and to ascribe to the federal courts , by mere implication , and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the State governments , a power which would involve such a consequence , would be altogether forced and unwarrantable . *stop*
Let us resume the train of our observations . *stop*
We have seen that the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court would be confined to two classes of causes , and those of a nature rarely to occur . *stop*
In all other cases of federal cognizance , the original jurisdiction would appertain to the inferior tribunals ; and the Supreme Court would have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction , `` with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make . '' *stop*
The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard to matters of law ; but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact . *stop*
Some well-intentioned men in this State , deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts , have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury , in favor of the civil-law mode of trial , which prevails in our courts of admiralty , probate , and chancery . *stop*
A technical sense has been affixed to the term `` appellate , '' which , in our law parlance , is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law . *stop*
But if I am not misinformed , the same meaning would not be given to it in any part of New England . *stop*
There an appeal from one jury to another , is familiar both in language and practice , and is even a matter of course , until there have been two verdicts on one side . *stop*
The word `` appellate , '' therefore , will not be understood in the same sense in New England as in New York , which shows the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular State . *stop*
The expression , taken in the abstract , denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another , either as to the law or fact , or both . *stop*
The mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or legislative provision ( in a new government it must depend on the latter ) , and may be with or without the aid of a jury , as may be judged advisable . *stop*
If , therefore , the re-examination of a fact once determined by a jury , should in any case be admitted under the proposed Constitution , it may be so regulated as to be done by a second jury , either by remanding the cause to the court below for a second trial of the fact , or by directing an issue immediately out of the Supreme Court . *stop*
But it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once ascertained by a jury , will be permitted in the Supreme Court . *stop*
Why may not it be said , with the strictest propriety , when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this State , that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the law ? *stop*
It is true it can not institute a new inquiry concerning the fact , but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record , and pronounces the law arising upon it . *stop*
This is jurisdiction of both fact and law ; nor is it even possible to separate them . *stop*
Though the common-law courts of this State ascertain disputed facts by a jury , yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both fact and law ; and accordingly when the former is agreed in the pleadings , they have no recourse to a jury , but proceed at once to judgment . *stop*
I contend , therefore , on this ground , that the expressions , `` appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , '' do not necessarily imply a re-examination in the Supreme Court of facts decided by juries in the inferior courts . *stop*
The following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the convention , in relation to this particular provision . *stop*
The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court ( it may have been argued ) will extend to causes determinable in different modes , some in the course of the COMMON LAW , others in the course of the CIVIL LAW . *stop*
In the former , the revision of the law only will be , generally speaking , the proper province of the Supreme Court ; in the latter , the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to usage , and in some cases , of which prize causes are an example , might be essential to the preservation of the public peace . *stop*
It is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should , in certain cases , extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact . *stop*
It will not answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried by a jury , because in the courts of some of the States all causes are tried in this mode ; and such an exception would preclude the revision of matters of fact , as well where it might be proper , as where it might be improper . *stop*
To avoid all inconveniencies , it will be safest to declare generally , that the Supreme Court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact , and that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and regulations as the national legislature may prescribe . *stop*
This will enable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best answer the ends of public justice and security . *stop*
This view of the matter , at any rate , puts it out of all doubt that the supposed abolition of the trial by jury , by the operation of this provision , is fallacious and untrue . *stop*
The legislature of the United States would certainly have full power to provide , that in appeals to the Supreme Court there should be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in the original causes by juries . *stop*
This would certainly be an authorized exception ; but if , for the reason already intimated , it should be thought too extensive , it might be qualified with a limitation to such causes only as are determinable at common law in that mode of trial . *stop*
The amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the judicial department is this : that it has been carefully restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of the national judicature ; that in the partition of this authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the Supreme Court , and the rest consigned to the subordinate tribunals ; that the Supreme Court will possess an appellate jurisdiction , both as to law and fact , in all the cases referred to them , both subject to any exceptions and regulations which may be thought advisable ; that this appellate jurisdiction does , in no case , abolish the trial by jury ; and that an ordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed judiciary , without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which have been predicted from that source . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
82 The Judiciary Continued . *stop*
From McLEAN 's Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE erection of a new government , whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work , can not fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety ; and these may , in a particular manner , be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties . *stop*
'T is time only that can mature and perfect so compound a system , can liquidate the meaning of all the parts , and can adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent WHOLE . *stop*
Such questions , accordingly , have arisen upon the plan proposed by the convention , and particularly concerning the judiciary department . *stop*
The principal of these respect the situation of the State courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction . *stop*
Is this to be exclusive , or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction ? *stop*
If the latter , in what relation will they stand to the national tribunals ? *stop*
These are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense , and which are certainly entitled to attention . *stop*
The principles established in a former paper teach us that the States will retain all pre-existing authorities which may not be exclusively delegated to the federal head ; and that this exclusive delegation can only exist in one of three cases : where an exclusive authority is , in express terms , granted to the Union ; or where a particular authority is granted to the Union , and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the States ; or where an authority is granted to the Union , with which a similar authority in the States would be utterly incompatible . *stop*
Though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power , yet I am inclined to think that they are , in the main , just with respect to the former , as well as the latter . *stop*
And under this impression , I shall lay it down as a rule , that the State courts will retain the jurisdiction they now have , unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes . *stop*
The only thing in the proposed Constitution , which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts , is contained in this passage : `` THE JUDICIAL POWER of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as the Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish . '' *stop*
This might either be construed to signify , that the supreme and subordinate courts of the Union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend ; or simply to denote , that the organs of the national judiciary should be one Supreme Court , and as many subordinate courts as Congress should think proper to appoint ; or in other words , that the United States should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested , through one supreme tribunal , and a certain number of inferior ones , to be instituted by them . *stop*
The first excludes , the last admits , the concurrent jurisdiction of the State tribunals ; and as the first would amount to an alienation of State power by implication , the last appears to me the most natural and the most defensible construction . *stop*
But this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the State courts have previous cognizance . *stop*
It is not equally evident in relation to cases which may grow out of , and be peculiar to , the Constitution to be established ; for not to allow the State courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases , can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing authority . *stop*
I mean not therefore to contend that the United States , in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction , may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely , if such a measure should be deemed expedient ; but I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction , further than may relate to an appeal ; and I am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature , they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth . *stop*
This I infer from the nature of judiciary power , and from the general genius of the system . *stop*
The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws , and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction , though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe . *stop*
Those of Japan , not less than of New York , may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts . *stop*
When in addition to this we consider the State governments and the national governments , as they truly are , in the light of kindred systems , and as parts of ONE WHOLE , the inference seems to be conclusive , that the State courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the Union , where it was not expressly prohibited . *stop*
Here another question occurs : What relation would subsist between the national and State courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction ? *stop*
I answer , that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter , to the Supreme Court of the United States . *stop*
The Constitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to have an original one , without a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts . *stop*
The objects of appeal , not the tribunals from which it is to be made , are alone contemplated . *stop*
From this circumstance , and from the reason of the thing , it ought to be construed to extend to the State tribunals . *stop*
Either this must be the case , or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern , else the judiciary authority of the Union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor . *stop*
Neither of these consequences ought , without evident necessity , to be involved ; the latter would be entirely inadmissible , as it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government , and would essentially embarrass its measures . *stop*
Nor do I perceive any foundation for such a supposition . *stop*
Agreeably to the remark already made , the national and State systems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE . *stop*
The courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the Union , and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of national decisions . *stop*
The evident aim of the plan of the convention is , that all the causes of the specified classes shall , for weighty public reasons , receive their original or final determination in the courts of the Union . *stop*
To confine , therefore , the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court , to appeals from the subordinate federal courts , instead of allowing their extension to the State courts , would be to abridge the latitude of the terms , in subversion of the intent , contrary to every sound rule of interpretation . *stop*
But could an appeal be made to lie from the State courts to the subordinate federal judicatories ? *stop*
This is another of the questions which have been raised , and of greater difficulty than the former . *stop*
The following considerations countenance the affirmative . *stop*
The plan of the convention , in the first place , authorizes the national legislature `` to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court . '' *stop*
It declares , in the next place , that `` the JUDICIAL POWER of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court , and in such inferior courts as Congress shall ordain and establish '' ; and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to which this judicial power shall extend . *stop*
It afterwards divides the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court into original and appellate , but gives no definition of that of the subordinate courts . *stop*
The only outlines described for them , are that they shall be `` inferior to the Supreme Court , '' and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal judiciary . *stop*
Whether their authority shall be original or appellate , or both , is not declared . *stop*
All this seems to be left to the discretion of the legislature . *stop*
And this being the case , I perceive at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the State courts to the subordinate national tribunals ; and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined . *stop*
It would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts , and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court . *stop*
The State tribunals may then be left with a more entire charge of federal causes ; and appeals , in most cases in which they may be deemed proper , instead of being carried to the Supreme Court , may be made to lie from the State courts to district courts of the Union . *stop*

83 The Judiciary Continued in Relation to Trial by Jury From MCLEAN 's Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : THE objection to the plan of the convention , which has met with most success in this State , and perhaps in several of the other States , is that relative to the want of a constitutional provision for the trial by jury in civil cases . *stop*
The disingenuous form in which this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed , but continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan . *stop*
The mere silence of the Constitution in regard to civil causes , is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury , and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal , extending not only to every species of civil , but even to criminal causes . *stop*
To argue with respect to the latter would , however , be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the existence of matter , or to demonstrate any of those propositions which , by their own internal evidence , force conviction , when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning . *stop*
With regard to civil causes , subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing which is only not provided for , is entirely abolished . *stop*
Every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between silence and abolition . *stop*
But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to support it by certain legal maxims of interpretation , which they have perverted from their true meaning , it may not be wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken . *stop*
The maxims on which they rely are of this nature : `` A specification of particulars is an exclusion of generals '' ; or , `` The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another . '' *stop*
Hence , say they , as the Constitution has established the trial by jury in criminal cases , and is silent in respect to civil , this silence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter . *stop*
The rules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense , adopted by the courts in the construction of the laws . *stop*
The true test , therefore , of a just application of them is its conformity to the source from which they are derived . *stop*
This being the case , let me ask if it is consistent with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislative power to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries , is a privation of its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in other cases ? *stop*
Is it natural to suppose , that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another , which there was a previous power to do , and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done ? *stop*
If such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable , it can not be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others . *stop*
A power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial ; and consequently , if nothing was said in the Constitution on the subject of juries , the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt that institution or to let it alone . *stop*
This discretion , in regard to criminal causes , is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all such cases ; but it is , of course , left at large in relation to civil causes , there being a total silence on this head . *stop*
The specification of an obligation to try all criminal causes in a particular mode , excludes indeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in civil causes , but does not abridge the power of the legislature to exercise that mode if it should be thought proper . *stop*
The pretense , therefore , that the national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries , is a pretense destitute of all just foundation . *stop*
From these observations this conclusion results : that the trial by jury in civil cases would not be abolished ; and that the use attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted , is contrary to reason and common-sense , and therefore not admissible . *stop*
Even if these maxims had a precise technical sense , corresponding with the idea of those who employ them upon the present occasion , which , however , is not the case , they would still be inapplicable to a constitution of government . *stop*
In relation to such a subject , the natural and obvious sense of its provisions , apart from any technical rules , is the true criterion of construction . *stop*
Having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made of them , let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning . *stop*
This will be best done by examples . *stop*
The plan of the convention declares that the power of Congress , or , in other words , of the national legislature , shall extend to certain enumerated cases . *stop*
This specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority , because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd , as well as useless , if a general authority was intended . *stop*
In like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is declared by the Constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly specified . *stop*
The expression of those cases marks the precise limits , beyond which the federal courts can not extend their jurisdiction , because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated , the specification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority . *stop*
These examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned , and to designate the manner in which they should be used . *stop*
But that there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject , I shall add one case more , to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims , and the abuse which has been made of them . *stop*
Let us suppose that by the laws of this State a married woman was incapable of conveying her estate , and that the legislature , considering this as an evil , should enact that she might dispose of her property by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate . *stop*
In such a case there can be no doubt but the specification would amount to an exclusion of any other mode of conveyance , because the woman having no previous power to alienate her property , the specification determines the particular mode which she is , for that purpose , to avail herself of . *stop*
But let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of three of her nearest relations , signified by their signing the deed ; could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value ? *stop*
The position is too absurd to merit a refutation , and yet this is precisely the position which those must establish who contend that the trial by juries in civil cases is abolished , because it is expressly provided for in cases of a criminal nature . *stop*
From these observations it must appear unquestionably true , that trial by jury is in no case abolished by the proposed Constitution , and it is equally true , that in those controversies between individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be interested , that institution will remain precisely in the same situation in which it is placed by the State constitutions , and will be in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan under consideration . *stop*
The foundation of this assertion is , that the national judiciary will have no cognizance of them , and of course they will remain determinable as heretofore by the State courts only , and in the manner which the State constitutions and laws prescribe . *stop*
All land causes , except where claims under the grants of different States come into question , and all other controversies between the citizens of the same State , unless where they depend upon positive violations of the articles of union , by acts of the State legislatures , will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of the State tribunals . *stop*
Add to this , that admiralty causes , and almost all those which are of equity jurisdiction , are determinable under our own government without the intervention of a jury , and the inference from the whole will be , that this institution , as it exists with us at present , can not possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed alteration in our system of government . *stop*
The friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention , if they agree in nothing else , concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury ; or if there is any difference between them it consists in this : the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty ; the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government . *stop*
For my own part , the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my observation , the more reason I have discovered for holding it in high estimation ; and it would be altogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a representative republic , or how much more merit it may be entitled to , as a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch , than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government . *stop*
Discussions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial , as all are satisfied of the utility of the institution , and of its friendly aspect to liberty . *stop*
But I must acknowledge that I can not readily discern the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty , and the trial by jury in civil cases . *stop*
Arbitrary impeachments , arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses , and arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions , have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial despotism ; and these have all relation to criminal proceedings . *stop*
The trial by jury in criminal cases , aided by the habeas corpus act , seems therefore to be alone concerned in the question . *stop*
And both of these are provided for , in the most ample manner , in the plan of the convention . *stop*
It has been observed , that trial by jury is a safeguard against an oppressive exercise of the power of taxation . *stop*
This observation deserves to be canvassed . *stop*
It is evident that it can have no influence upon the legislature , in regard to the amount of taxes to be laid , to the objects upon which they are to be imposed , or to the rule by which they are to be apportioned . *stop*
If it can have any influence , therefore , it must be upon the mode of collection , and the conduct of the officers intrusted with the execution of the revenue laws . *stop*
As to the mode of collection in this State , under our own Constitution , the trial by jury is in most cases out of use . *stop*
The taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress and sale , as in cases of rent . *stop*
And it is acknowledged on all hands , that this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws . *stop*
The dilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on individuals , would neither suit the exigencies of the public nor promote the convenience of the citizens . *stop*
It would often occasion an accumulation of costs , more burdensome than the original sum of the tax to be levied . *stop*
And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue , the provision in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases , will afford the security aimed at . *stop*
Wilful abuses of a public authority , to the oppression of the subject , and every species of official extortion , are offenses against the government , for which the persons who commit them may be indicted and punished according to the circumstances of the case . *stop*
The excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty . *stop*
The strongest argument in its favor is , that it is a security against corruption . *stop*
As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the occasion , there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more easily find its way to the former than to the latter . *stop*
The force of this consideration is , however , diminished by others . *stop*
The sheriff , who is the summoner of ordinary juries , and the clerks of courts , who have the nomination of special juries , are themselves standing officers , and , acting individually , may be supposed more accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges , who are a collective body . *stop*
It is not difficult to see , that it would be in the power of those officers to select jurors who would serve the purpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench . *stop*
In the next place , it may fairly be supposed , that there would be less difficulty in gaining some of the jurors promiscuously taken from the public mass , than in gaining men who had been chosen by the government for their probity and good character . *stop*
But making every deduction for these considerations , the trial by jury must still be a valuable check upon corruption . *stop*
It greatly multiplies the impediments to its success . *stop*
As matters now stand , it would be necessary to corrupt both court and jury ; for where the jury have gone evidently wrong , the court will generally grant a new trial , and it would be in most cases of little use to practice upon the jury , unless the court could be likewise gained . *stop*
Here then is a double security ; and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions . *stop*
By increasing the obstacles to success , it discourages attempts to seduce the integrity of either . *stop*
The temptations to prostitution which the judges might have to surmount , must certainly be much fewer , while the co-operation of a jury is necessary , than they might be , if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all causes . *stop*
Notwithstanding , therefore , the doubts I have expressed , as to the essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty , I admit that it is in most cases , under proper regulations , an excellent method of determining questions of property ; and that on this account alone it would be entitled to a constitutional provision in its favor if it were possible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended . *stop*
There is , however , in all cases , great difficulty in this ; and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal government , which is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in relation to the matter materially vary from each other , that difficulty must be not a little augmented . *stop*
For my own part , at every new view I take of the subject , I become more convinced of the reality of the obstacles which , we are authoritatively informed , prevented the insertion of a provision on this head in the plan of the convention . *stop*
The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different States is not generally understood ; and as it must have considerable influence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the omission complained of in regard to this point , an explanation of it is necessary . *stop*
In this State , our judicial establishments resemble , more nearly than in any other , those of Great Britain . *stop*
We have courts of common law , courts of probates ( analogous in certain matters to the spiritual courts in England ) , a court of admiralty and a court of chancery . *stop*
In the courts of common law only , the trial by jury prevails , and this with some exceptions . *stop*
In all the others a single judge presides , and proceeds in general either according to the course of the canon or civil law , without the aid of a jury . *stop*
In New Jersey , there is a court of chancery which proceeds like ours , but neither courts of admiralty nor of probates , in the sense in which these last are established with us . *stop*
In that State the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes which with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of probates , and of course the jury trial is more extensive in New Jersey than in New York . *stop*
In Pennsylvania , this is perhaps still more the case , for there is no court of chancery in that State , and its common-law courts have equity jurisdiction . *stop*
It has a court of admiralty , but none of probates , at least on the plan of ours . *stop*
Delaware has in these respects imitated Pennsylvania . *stop*
Maryland approaches more nearly to New York , as does also Virginia , except that the latter has a plurality of chancellors . *stop*
North Carolina bears most affinity to Pennsylvania ; South Carolina to Virginia . *stop*
I believe , however , that in some of those States which have distinct courts of admiralty , the causes depending in them are triable by juries . *stop*
In Georgia there are none but common-law courts , and an appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another , which is called a special jury , and for which a particular mode of appointment is marked out . *stop*
In Connecticut , they have no distinct courts either of chancery or of admiralty , and their courts of probates have no jurisdiction of causes . *stop*
Their common-law courts have admiralty and , to a certain extent , equity jurisdiction . *stop*
In cases of importance , their General Assembly is the only court of chancery . *stop*
In Connecticut , therefore , the trial by jury extends in practice further than in any other State yet mentioned . *stop*
Rhode Island is , I believe , in this particular , pretty much in the situation of Connecticut . *stop*
Massachusetts and New Hampshire , in regard to the blending of law , equity , and admiralty jurisdictions , are in a similar predicament . *stop*
In the four Eastern States , the trial by jury not only stands upon a broader foundation than in the other States , but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown , in its full extent , to any of them . *stop*
There is an appeal of course from one jury to another , till there have been two verdicts out of three on one side . *stop*
From this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity , as well in the modification as in the extent of the institution of trial by jury in civil cases , in the several States ; and from this fact these obvious reflections flow : first , that no general rule could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have corresponded with the circumstances of all the States ; and secondly , that more or at least as much might have been hazarded by taking the system of any one State for a standard , as by omitting a provision altogether and leaving the matter , as has been done , to legislative regulation . *stop*
The propositions which have been made for supplying the omission have rather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing . *stop*
The minority of Pennsylvania have proposed this mode of expression for the purpose -- '' Trial by jury shall be as heretofore '' -- and this I maintain would be senseless and nugatory . *stop*
The United States , in their united or collective capacity , are the OBJECT to which all general provisions in the Constitution must necessarily be construed to refer . *stop*
Now it is evident that though trial by jury , with various limitations , is known in each State individually , yet in the United States , as such , it is at this time altogether unknown , because the present federal government has no judiciary power whatever ; and consequently there is no proper antecedent or previous establishment to which the term heretofore could relate . *stop*
It would therefore be destitute of a precise meaning , and inoperative from its uncertainty . *stop*
As , on the one hand , the form of the provision would not fulfil the intent of its proposers , so , on the other , if I apprehend that intent rightly , it would be in itself inexpedient . *stop*
I presume it to be , that causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury , if , in the State where the courts sat , that mode of trial would obtain in a similar case in the State courts ; that is to say , admiralty causes should be tried in Connecticut by a jury , in New York without one . *stop*
The capricious operation of so dissimilar a method of trial in the same cases , under the same government , is of itself sufficient to indispose every wellregulated judgment towards it . *stop*
Whether the cause should be tried with or without a jury , would depend , in a great number of cases , on the accidental situation of the court and parties . *stop*
But this is not , in my estimation , the greatest objection . *stop*
I feel a deep and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in which the trial by jury is an ineligible one . *stop*
I think it so particularly in cases which concern the public peace with foreign nations -- that is , in most cases where the question turns wholly on the laws of nations . *stop*
Of this nature , among others , are all prize causes . *stop*
Juries can not be supposed competent to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations ; and they will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries . *stop*
There would of course be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their decisions , so as to afford occasions of reprisal and war . *stop*
Though the proper province of juries be to determine matters of fact , yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation impracticable . *stop*
It will add great weight to this remark , in relation to prize causes , to mention that the method of determining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of Europe , and that , pursuant to such treaties , they are determinable in Great Britain , in the last resort , before the king himself , in his privy council , where the fact , as well as the law , undergoes a re-examination . *stop*
This alone demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the Constitution which would make the State systems a standard for the national government in the article under consideration , and the danger of encumbering the government with any constitutional provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable . *stop*
My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction , and that the causes which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries . *stop*
The great and primary use of a court of equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases , which are exceptions to general rules . *stop*
To unite the jurisdiction of such cases with the ordinary jurisdiction , must have a tendency to unsettle the general rules , and to subject every case that arises to a special determination ; while a separation of the one from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the other , and of keeping each within the expedient limits . *stop*
Besides this , the circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are in many instances so nice and intricate , that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury . *stop*
They require often such long , deliberate , and critical investigation as would be impracticable to men called from their occupations , and obliged to decide before they were permitted to return to them . *stop*
The simplicity and expedition which form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious point ; while the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent particulars . *stop*
It is true that the separation of the equity from the legal jurisdiction is peculiar to the English system of jurisprudence : which is the model that has been followed in several of the States . *stop*
But it is equally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in every case in which they have been united . *stop*
And the separation is essential to the preservation of that institution in its pristine purity . *stop*
The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law ; but it is not a little to be suspected , that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery , on the plan upon which they are established in this State , but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law , and to undermine the trial by jury , by introducing questions too complicated for a decision in that mode . *stop*
These appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating the systems of all the States , in the formation of the national judiciary , according to what may be conjectured to have been the attempt of the Pennsylvania minority . *stop*
Let us now examine how far the proposition of Massachusetts is calculated to remedy the supposed defect . *stop*
It is in this form : `` In civil actions between citizens of different States , every issue of fact , arising in actions at common law , may be tried by a jury if the parties , or either of them request it . '' *stop*
This , at best , is a proposition confined to one description of causes ; and the inference is fair , either that the Massachusetts convention considered that as the only class of federal causes , in which the trial by jury would be proper ; or that if desirous of a more extensive provision , they found it impracticable to devise one which would properly answer the end . *stop*
If the first , the omission of a regulation respecting so partial an object can never be considered as a material imperfection in the system . *stop*
If the last , it affords a strong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing . *stop*
But this is not all : if we advert to the observations already made respecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the Union , and the different powers exercised by them , it will appear that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which have been employed to characterize that species of causes which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury . *stop*
In this State , the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable jurisdiction , are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail in England upon that subject . *stop*
In many of the other States the boundaries are less precise . *stop*
In some of them every cause is to be tried in a court of common law , and upon that foundation every action may be considered as an action at common law , to be determined by a jury , if the parties , or either of them , choose it . *stop*
Hence the same irregularity and confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition , that I have already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the Pennsylvania minority . *stop*
In one State a cause would receive its determination from a jury , if the parties , or either of them , requested it ; but in another State , a cause exactly similar to the other , must be decided without the intervention of a jury , because the State judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction . *stop*
It is obvious , therefore , that the Massachusetts proposition , upon this subject can not operate as a general regulation , until some uniform plan , with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions , shall be adopted by the different States . *stop*
To devise a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself , and which it would require much time and reflection to mature . *stop*
It would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the States in the Union , or that would perfectly quadrate with the several State institutions . *stop*
It may be asked , Why could not a reference have been made to the constitution of this State , taking that , which is allowed by me to be a good one , as a standard for the United States ? *stop*
I answer that it is not very probable the other States would entertain the same opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves . *stop*
It is natural to suppose that they are hitherto more attached to their own , and that each would struggle for the preference . *stop*
If the plan of taking one State as a model for the whole had been thought of in the convention , it is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each representation in favor of its own government ; and it must be uncertain which of the States would have been taken as the model . *stop*
It has been shown that many of them would be improper ones . *stop*
And I leave it to conjecture , whether , under all circumstances , it is most likely that New York , or some other State , would have been preferred . *stop*
But admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in the convention , still there would have been great danger of jealousy and disgust in the other States , at the partiality which had been shown to the institutions of one . *stop*
The enemies of the plan would have been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudices against it , which perhaps might have hazarded , in no inconsiderable degree , its final establishment . *stop*
To avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the trial by jury ought to embrace , it is sometimes suggested by men of enthusiastic tempers , that a provision might have been inserted for establishing it in all cases whatsoever . *stop*
For this I believe , no precedent is to be found in any member of the Union ; and the considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of the minority of Pennsylvania , must satisfy every sober mind that the establishment of the trial by jury in all cases would have been an unpardonable error in the plan . *stop*
In short , the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too little to answer the purpose , or too much to be advisable ; or which might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and essential object of introducing a firm national government . *stop*
I can not but persuade myself , on the other hand , that the different lights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these observations , will go far towards removing in candid minds the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point . *stop*
They have tended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal cases , which is provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention ; that even in far the greatest proportion of civil cases , and those in which the great body of the community is interested , that mode of trial will remain in its full force , as established in the State constitutions , untouched and unaffected by the plan of the convention ; that it is in no case abolished by that plan ; and that there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper provision for it in a Constitution for the United States . *stop*
The best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases , and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails . *stop*
For my part , I acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this State it might be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply , and might as advantageously be abridged in others . *stop*
It is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases . *stop*
The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits , as well in these States as in Great Britain , afford a strong presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient , and give room to suppose that future experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions . *stop*
I suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop , and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the legislature . *stop*
This is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain , and it is equally so in the State of Connecticut ; and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial by jury in this State since the Revolution , though provided for by a positive article of our constitution , than has happened in the same time either in Connecticut or Great Britain . *stop*
It may be added that these encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty , but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career . *stop*
The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects . *stop*
Particular provisions , though not altogether useless , have far less virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them ; and the want of them will never be , with men of sound discernment , a decisive objection to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government . *stop*
It certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that there is no security for liberty in a Constitution which expressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases , because it does not do it in civil also ; while it is a notorious fact that Connecticut , which has been always regarded as the most popular State in the Union , can boast of no constitutional provision for either . *stop*

84 Certain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution Considered and Answered . *stop*
From McLEAN 's Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : IN THE course of the foregoing review of the Constitution , I have taken notice of , and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared against it . *stop*
There , however , remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their proper places . *stop*
These shall now be discussed ; but as the subject has been drawn into great length , I shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper . *stop*
The most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights . *stop*
Among other answers given to this , it has been upon different occasions remarked that the constitutions of several of the States are in a similar predicament . *stop*
I add that New York is of the number . *stop*
And yet the opposers of the new system , in this State , who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution , are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of rights . *stop*
To justify their zeal in this matter , they allege two things : one is that , though the constitution of New York has no bill of rights prefixed to it , yet it contains , in the body of it , various provisions in favor of particular privileges and rights , which , in substance amount to the same thing ; the other is , that the Constitution adopts , in their full extent , the common and statute law of Great Britain , by which many other rights , not expressed in it , are equally secured . *stop*
To the first I answer , that the Constitution proposed by the convention contains , as well as the constitution of this State , a number of such provisions . *stop*
Independent of those which relate to the structure of the government , we find the following : Article 1 , section 3 , clause 7 -- '' Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor , trust , or profit under the United States ; but the party convicted shall , nevertheless , be liable and subject to indictment , trial , judgment , and punishment according to law . '' *stop*
Section 9 , of the same article , clause 2 -- '' The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . '' *stop*
Clause 3 -- '' No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be passed . '' *stop*
Clause 7 -- '' No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States ; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the Congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state . '' *stop*
Article 3 , section 2 , clause 3 -- '' The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury ; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any State , the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed . '' *stop*
Section 3 , of the same article -- '' Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . *stop*
No person shall be convicted of treason , unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act , or on confession in open court . '' *stop*
And clause 3 , of the same section -- '' The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason ; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood , or forfeiture , except during the life of the person attainted . '' *stop*
It may well be a question , whether these are not , upon the whole , of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this State . *stop*
The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus , the prohibition of ex post facto laws , and of TITLES OF NOBILITY , to which we have no corresponding provision in our Constitution , are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains . *stop*
The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact , or , in other words , the subjecting of men to punishment for things which , when they were done , were breaches of no law , and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments , have been , in all ages , the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny . *stop*
The observations of the judicious Blackstone , in reference to the latter , are well worthy of recital : `` To bereave a man of life , ( says he ) or by violence to confiscate his estate , without accusation or trial , would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism , as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation ; but confinement of the person , by secretly hurrying him to jail , where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten , is a less public , a less striking , and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government . '' *stop*
And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act , which in one place he calls `` the BULWARK of the British Constitution . '' *stop*
Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility . *stop*
This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government ; for so long as they are excluded , there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people . *stop*
To the second that is , to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the Constitution , I answer , that they are expressly made subject `` to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same . '' *stop*
They are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power , and of course have no constitutional sanction . *stop*
The only use of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the Revolution . *stop*
This consequently can be considered as no part of a declaration of rights , which under our constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself . *stop*
It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are , in their origin , stipulations between kings and their subjects , abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege , reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince . *stop*
Such was MAGNA CHARTA , obtained by the barons , sword in hand , from King John . *stop*
Such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes . *stop*
Such was the Petition of Right assented to by Charles I. , in the beginning of his reign . *stop*
Such , also , was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688 , and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights . *stop*
It is evident , therefore , that , according to their primitive signification , they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people , and executed by their immediate representatives and servants . *stop*
Here , in strictness , the people surrender nothing ; and as they retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations . *stop*
`` WE , THE PEOPLE of the United States , to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America . '' *stop*
Here is a better recognition of popular rights , than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our State bills of rights , and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government . *stop*
But a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a Constitution like that under consideration , which is merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation , than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns . *stop*
If , therefore , the loud clamors against the plan of the convention , on this score , are well founded , no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this State . *stop*
But the truth is , that both of them contain all which , in relation to their objects , is reasonably to be desired . *stop*
I go further , and affirm that bills of rights , in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for , are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution , but would even be dangerous . *stop*
They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted ; and , on this very account , would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted . *stop*
For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do ? *stop*
Why , for instance , should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained , when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed ? *stop*
I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power ; but it is evident that it would furnish , to men disposed to usurp , a plausible pretense for claiming that power . *stop*
They might urge with a semblance of reason , that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given , and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication , that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government . *stop*
This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers , by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights . *stop*
On the subject of the liberty of the press , as much as has been said , I can not forbear adding a remark or two : in the first place , I observe , that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this State ; in the next , I contend , that whatever has been said about it in that of any other State , amounts to nothing . *stop*
What signifies a declaration , that `` the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved '' ? *stop*
What is the liberty of the press ? *stop*
Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion ? *stop*
I hold it to be impracticable ; and from this I infer , that its security , whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it , must altogether depend on public opinion , and on the general spirit of the people and of the government . *stop*
And here , after all , as is intimated upon another occasion , must we seek for the only solid basis of all our rights . *stop*
There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point . *stop*
The truth is , after all the declamations we have heard , that the Constitution is itself , in every rational sense , and to every useful purpose , A BILL OF RIGHTS . *stop*
The several bills of rights in Great Britain form its Constitution , and conversely the constitution of each State is its bill of rights . *stop*
And the proposed Constitution , if adopted , will be the bill of rights of the Union . *stop*
Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of the government ? *stop*
This is done in the most ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention ; comprehending various precautions for the public security , which are not to be found in any of the State constitutions . *stop*
Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding , which are relative to personal and private concerns ? *stop*
This we have seen has also been attended to , in a variety of cases , in the same plan . *stop*
Adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights , it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention . *stop*
It may be said that it does not go far enough , though it will not be easy to make this appear ; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no such thing . *stop*
It certainly must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens , if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which establishes the government . *stop*
And hence it must be apparent , that much of what has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions , entirely foreign from the substance of the thing . *stop*
Another objection which has been made , and which , from the frequency of its repetition , it is to be presumed is relied on , is of this nature : '' It is improper ( say the objectors ) to confer such large powers , as are proposed , upon the national government , because the seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from many of the States to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent , of the conduct of the representative body . '' *stop*
This argument , if it proves any thing , proves that there ought to be no general government whatever . *stop*
For the powers which , it seems to be agreed on all hands , ought to be vested in the Union , can not be safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite control . *stop*
But there are satisfactory reasons to show that the objection is in reality not well founded . *stop*
There is in most of the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the imagination . *stop*
What are the sources of information by which the people in Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the conduct of their representatives in the State legislature ? *stop*
Of personal observation they can have no benefit . *stop*
This is confined to the citizens on the spot . *stop*
They must therefore depend on the information of intelligent men , in whom they confide ; and how must these men obtain their information ? *stop*
Evidently from the complexion of public measures , from the public prints , from correspondences with their representatives , and with other persons who reside at the place of their deliberations . *stop*
This does not apply to Montgomery County only , but to all the counties at any considerable distance from the seat of government . *stop*
It is equally evident that the same sources of information would be open to the people in relation to the conduct of their representatives in the general government , and the impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create , will be overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the State governments . *stop*
The executive and legislative bodies of each State will be so many sentinels over the persons employed in every department of the national administration ; and as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of intelligence , they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in the national councils , and can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people . *stop*
Their disposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter , may be relied upon , if it were only from the rivalship of power . *stop*
And we may conclude with the fullest assurance that the people , through that channel , will be better informed of the conduct of their national representatives , than they can be by any means they now possess of that of their State representatives . *stop*
It ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the seat of government will , in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity , have the same interest with those who are at a distance , and that they will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary , and to point out the actors in any pernicious project . *stop*
The public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the Union . *stop*
Among the many curious objections which have appeared against the proposed Constitution , the most extraordinary and the least colorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due to the United States . *stop*
This has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts , and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters . *stop*
The newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head ; yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation , the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty . *stop*
In addition to the remarks I have made upon the subject in another place , I shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of common-sense , so it is also an established doctrine of political law , that `` States neither lose any of their rights , nor are discharged from any of their obligations , by a change in the form of their civil government . '' *stop*
The last objection of any consequence , which I at present recollect , turns upon the article of expense . *stop*
If it were even true , that the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of expense , it would be an objection that ought to have no weight against the plan . *stop*
The great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason convinced , that Union is the basis of their political happiness . *stop*
Men of sense of all parties now , with few exceptions , agree that it can not be preserved under the present system , nor without radical alterations ; that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head , and that these require a different organization of the federal government -- a single body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities . *stop*
In conceding all this , the question of expense must be given up ; for it is impossible , with any degree of safety , to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand . *stop*
The two branches of the legislature are , in the first instance , to consist of only sixty-five persons , which is the same number of which Congress , under the existing Confederation , may be composed . *stop*
It is true that this number is intended to be increased ; but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of the country . *stop*
It is evident that a less number would , even in the first instance , have been unsafe , and that a continuance of the present number would , in a more advanced stage of population , be a very inadequate representation of the people . *stop*
Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring ? *stop*
One source indicated , is the multiplication of offices under the new government . *stop*
Let us examine this a little . *stop*
It is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present government , are the same which will be required under the new . *stop*
There are now a Secretary of War , a Secretary of Foreign Affairs , a Secretary for Domestic Affairs , a Board of Treasury , consisting of three persons , a Treasurer , assistants , clerks , etc . *stop*
These officers are indispensable under any system , and will suffice under the new as well as the old . *stop*
As to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries , the proposed Constitution can make no other difference than to render their characters , where they reside , more respectable , and their services more useful . *stop*
As to persons to be employed in the collection of the revenues , it is unquestionably true that these will form a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers ; but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of public expense . *stop*
It will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of State for national officers . *stop*
In the collection of all duties , for instance , the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description . *stop*
The States individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose . *stop*
What difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the State or by the United States ? *stop*
There is no good reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than those of the former . *stop*
Where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been represented to us ? *stop*
The chief item which occurs to me respects the support of the judges of the United States . *stop*
I do not add the President , because there is now a president of Congress , whose expenses may not be far , if any thing , short of those which will be incurred on account of the President of the United States . *stop*
The support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense , but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter . *stop*
But upon no reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence . *stop*
Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed government . *stop*
The first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the President . *stop*
Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him , according to general principles concerted with the Senate , and subject to their final concurrence . *stop*
Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of Representatives ; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a third , or perhaps half , for the former . *stop*
The extra business of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the Senate . *stop*
From this circumstance we may infer that , until the House of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number , there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future Congress . *stop*
But there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of economy . *stop*
The business of the United States has hitherto occupied the State legislatures , as well as Congress . *stop*
The latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for . *stop*
Hence it has happened that the sessions of the State legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the States . *stop*
More than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the United States . *stop*
Now the members who compose the legislatures of the several States amount to two thousand and upwards , which number has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons , and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of that number . *stop*
The Congress under the proposed government will do all the business of the United States themselves , without the intervention of the State legislatures , who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular States , and will not have to sit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done . *stop*
This difference in the time of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain , and will alone form an article of saving , which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system . *stop*
The result from these observations is that the sources of additional expense from the establishment of the proposed Constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined ; that they are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving ; and that while it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate , it is certain that a government less expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the Union . *stop*
PUBLIUS FEDERALIST No . *stop*
85 Concluding Remarks From MCLEAN 's Edition , New York . *stop*
Wednesday , May 28 , 1788 HAMILTON To the People of the State of New York : ACCORDING to the formal division of the subject of these papers , announced in my first number , there would appear still to remain for discussion two points : `` the analogy of the proposed government to your own State constitution , '' and `` the additional security which its adoption will afford to republican government , to liberty , and to property . '' *stop*
But these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress of the work , that it would now scarcely be possible to do any thing more than repeat , in a more dilated form , what has been heretofore said , which the advanced stage of the question , and the time already spent upon it , conspire to forbid . *stop*
It is remarkable , that the resemblance of the plan of the convention to the act which organizes the government of this State holds , not less with regard to many of the supposed defects , than to the real excellences of the former . *stop*
Among the pretended defects are the re-eligibility of the Executive , the want of a council , the omission of a formal bill of rights , the omission of a provision respecting the liberty of the press . *stop*
These and several others which have been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the existing constitution of this State , as on the one proposed for the Union ; and a man must have slender pretensions to consistency , who can rail at the latter for imperfections which he finds no difficulty in excusing in the former . *stop*
Nor indeed can there be a better proof of the insincerity and affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention among us , who profess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which they live , than the fury with which they have attacked that plan , for matters in regard to which our own constitution is equally or perhaps more vulnerable . *stop*
The additional securities to republican government , to liberty and to property , to be derived from the adoption of the plan under consideration , consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation of the Union will impose on local factions and insurrections , and on the ambition of powerful individuals in single States , who may acquire credit and influence enough , from leaders and favorites , to become the despots of the people ; in the diminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue , which the dissolution of the Confederacy would invite and facilitate ; in the prevention of extensive military establishments , which could not fail to grow out of wars between the States in a disunited situation ; in the express guaranty of a republican form of government to each ; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles of nobility ; and in the precautions against the repetition of those practices on the part of the State governments which have undermined the foundations of property and credit , have planted mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens , and have occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals . *stop*
Thus have I , fellow-citizens , executed the task I had assigned to myself ; with what success , your conduct must determine . *stop*
I trust at least you will admit that I have not failed in the assurance I gave you respecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be conducted . *stop*
I have addressed myself purely to your judgments , and have studiously avoided those asperities which are too apt to disgrace political disputants of all parties , and which have been not a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents of the Constitution . *stop*
The charge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people , which has been indiscriminately brought against the advocates of the plan , has something in it too wanton and too malignant , not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his own bosom a refutation of the calumny . *stop*
The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy , the well-born , and the great , have been such as to inspire the disgust of all sensible men . *stop*
And the unwarrantable concealments and misrepresentations which have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the public eye , have been of a nature to demand the reprobation of all honest men . *stop*
It is not impossible that these circumstances may have occasionally betrayed me into intemperances of expression which I did not intend ; it is certain that I have frequently felt a struggle between sensibility and moderation ; and if the former has in some instances prevailed , it must be my excuse that it has been neither often nor much . *stop*
Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether , in the course of these papers , the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it ; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation , and necessary to the public safety and prosperity . *stop*
Every man is bound to answer these questions to himself , according to the best of his conscience and understanding , and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober dictates of his judgment . *stop*
This is a duty from which nothing can give him a dispensation . *stop*
'T is one that he is called upon , nay , constrained by all the obligations that form the bands of society , to discharge sincerely and honestly . *stop*
No partial motive , no particular interest , no pride of opinion , no temporary passion or prejudice , will justify to himself , to his country , or to his posterity , an improper election of the part he is to act . *stop*
Let him beware of an obstinate adherence to party ; let him reflect that the object upon which he is to decide is not a particular interest of the community , but the very existence of the nation ; and let him remember that a majority of America has already given its sanction to the plan which he is to approve or reject . *stop*
I shall not dissemble that I feel an entire confidence in the arguments which recommend the proposed system to your adoption , and that I am unable to discern any real force in those by which it has been opposed . *stop*
I am persuaded that it is the best which our political situation , habits , and opinions will admit , and superior to any the revolution has produced . *stop*
Concessions on the part of the friends of the plan , that it has not a claim to absolute perfection , have afforded matter of no small triumph to its enemies . *stop*
`` Why , '' say they , `` should we adopt an imperfect thing ? *stop*
Why not amend it and make it perfect before it is irrevocably established ? '' *stop*
This may be plausible enough , but it is only plausible . *stop*
In the first place I remark , that the extent of these concessions has been greatly exaggerated . *stop*
They have been stated as amounting to an admission that the plan is radically defective , and that without material alterations the rights and the interests of the community can not be safely confided to it . *stop*
This , as far as I have understood the meaning of those who make the concessions , is an entire perversion of their sense . *stop*
No advocate of the measure can be found , who will not declare as his sentiment , that the system , though it may not be perfect in every part , is , upon the whole , a good one ; is the best that the present views and circumstances of the country will permit ; and is such an one as promises every species of security which a reasonable people can desire . *stop*
I answer in the next place , that I should esteem it the extreme of imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national affairs , and to expose the Union to the jeopardy of successive experiments , in the chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan . *stop*
I never expect to see a perfect work from imperfect man . *stop*
The result of the deliberations of all collective bodies must necessarily be a compound , as well of the errors and prejudices , as of the good sense and wisdom , of the individuals of whom they are composed . *stop*
The compacts which are to embrace thirteen distinct States in a common bond of amity and union , must as necessarily be a compromise of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations . *stop*
How can perfection spring from such materials ? *stop*
The reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately published in this city , are unanswerable to show the utter improbability of assembling a new convention , under circumstances in any degree so favorable to a happy issue , as those in which the late convention met , deliberated , and concluded . *stop*
I will not repeat the arguments there used , as I presume the production itself has had an extensive circulation . *stop*
It is certainly well worthy the perusal of every friend to his country . *stop*
There is , however , one point of light in which the subject of amendments still remains to be considered , and in which it has not yet been exhibited to public view . *stop*
I can not resolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it in this aspect . *stop*
It appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration , that it will be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the Constitution . *stop*
The moment an alteration is made in the present plan , it becomes , to the purpose of adoption , a new one , and must undergo a new decision of each State . *stop*
To its complete establishment throughout the Union , it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen States . *stop*
If , on the contrary , the Constitution proposed should once be ratified by all the States as it stands , alterations in it may at any time be effected by nine States . *stop*
Here , then , the chances are as thirteen to nine in favor of subsequent amendment , rather than of the original adoption of an entire system . *stop*
This is not all . *stop*
Every Constitution for the United States must inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars , in which thirteen independent States are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions of interest . *stop*
We may of course expect to see , in any body of men charged with its original formation , very different combinations of the parts upon different points . *stop*
Many of those who form a majority on one question , may become the minority on a second , and an association dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third . *stop*
Hence the necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole , in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact ; and hence , also , an immense multiplication of difficulties and casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act . *stop*
The degree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number of particulars and the number of parties . *stop*
But every amendment to the Constitution , if once established , would be a single proposition , and might be brought forward singly . *stop*
There would then be no necessity for management or compromise , in relation to any other point -- no giving nor taking . *stop*
The will of the requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue . *stop*
And consequently , whenever nine , or rather ten States , were united in the desire of a particular amendment , that amendment must infallibly take place . *stop*
There can , therefore , be no comparison between the facility of affecting an amendment , and that of establishing in the first instance a complete Constitution . *stop*
In opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments , it has been urged that the persons delegated to the administration of the national government will always be disinclined to yield up any portion of the authority of which they were once possessed . *stop*
For my own part I acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may , upon mature consideration , be thought useful , will be applicable to the organization of the government , not to the mass of its powers ; and on this account alone , I think there is no weight in the observation just stated . *stop*
I also think there is little weight in it on another account . *stop*
The intrinsic difficulty of governing THIRTEEN STATES at any rate , independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public spirit and integrity , will , in my opinion constantly impose on the national rulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonable expectations of their constituents . *stop*
But there is yet a further consideration , which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt , that the observation is futile . *stop*
It is this that the national rulers , whenever nine States concur , will have no option upon the subject . *stop*
By the fifth article of the plan , the Congress will be obliged `` on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the States ( which at present amount to nine ) , to call a convention for proposing amendments , which shall be valid , to all intents and purposes , as part of the Constitution , when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the States , or by conventions in three fourths thereof .

The words of this article are peremptory . *stop*
The Congress `` shall call a convention . '' *stop*
Nothing in this particular is left to the discretion of that body . *stop*
And of consequence , all the declamation about the disinclination to a change vanishes in air . *stop*
Nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two thirds or three fourths of the State legislatures , in amendments which may affect local interests , can there be any room to apprehend any such difficulty in a union on points which are merely relative to the general liberty or security of the people . *stop*
We may safely rely on the disposition of the State legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority . *stop*
If the foregoing argument is a fallacy , certain it is that I am myself deceived by it , for it is , in my conception , one of those rare instances in which a political truth can be brought to the test of a mathematical demonstration . *stop*
Those who see the matter in the same light with me , however zealous they may be for amendments , must agree in the propriety of a previous adoption , as the most direct road to their own object . *stop*
The zeal for attempts to amend , prior to the establishment of the Constitution , must abate in every man who is ready to accede to the truth of the following observations of a writer equally solid and ingenious : `` To balance a large state or society ( says he ) , whether monarchical or republican , on general laws , is a work of so great difficulty , that no human genius , however comprehensive , is able , by the mere dint of reason and reflection , to effect it . *stop*
The judgments of many must unite in the work ; EXPERIENCE must guide their labor ; TIME must bring it to perfection , and the FEELING of inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall into in their first trials and experiments . '' *stop*
These judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the Union , and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy , civil war , a perpetual alienation of the States from each other , and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue , in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain , but from TIME and EXPERIENCE . *stop*
It may be in me a defect of political fortitude , but I acknowledge that I can not entertain an equal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer continuance in our present situation as imaginary . *stop*
A NATION , without a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT , is , in my view , an awful spectacle . *stop*
The establishment of a Constitution , in time of profound peace , by the voluntary consent of a whole people , is a PRODIGY , to the completion of which I look forward with trembling anxiety . *stop*
I can reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have , in so arduous an enterprise , upon seven out of the thirteen States , and after having passed over so considerable a part of the ground , to recommence the course . *stop*
I dread the more the consequences of new attempts , because I know that POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS , in this and in other States , are enemies to a general national government in every possible shape . *stop*
